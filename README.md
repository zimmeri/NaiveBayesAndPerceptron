Naive Bayes and Perceptron machine learning algorithms

Wrote a Na√Øve Bayes probabilistic theory machine learning algorithm and perceptron neural network to determine if a movie review was positive or negative.

Used data/given/train.tsv to train the algorithms
Used data/given/test.tsv to test the accuracy and precision of algorithms

Naive bayes algorithm is located in src/naive_bayes.py
Perceptron algorithm is located in src/perceptron.py

Was able to achieve maximum accuracy of 77.41% with naive bayes and 71.43 with perceptron.  While these accuracies are not optimal, this was a 2 week project where 
I was unable to fine tune the algorithms.

More analysis can be found in report/report.pdf with accompanying questions in handout.pdf.
