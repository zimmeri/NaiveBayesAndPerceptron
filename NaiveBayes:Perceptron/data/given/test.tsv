pos_0	films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .  for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .  the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .  in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?  the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .  it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .  when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .  abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .  upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .  i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .  in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .  it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .  and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) .  don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .  now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .  the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .  oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .  even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .  ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .  the film , however , is all good .  2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content  	positive
pos_3	 " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .  the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds .  then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score .  dah-dum .  from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .  perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie .  he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .  unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .  until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .  he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .  he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .  the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .  brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it's a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying .  when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .   " jaws " is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .  it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) .  even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's " psycho , " and it never seems to age .  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .  scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time " jaws " was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .  nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .   " it's your first summer here , you know , " mayor vaughn warns him .  dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in " american graffiti " ( 1973 ) and " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz " ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .  however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .  bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .  he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .  however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .  indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .  shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .  of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in " jaws , " and they are a threat .  every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .  the shark in " jaws " was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .  many have forgotten , but " jaws " was a sort of precursor to " waterworld " ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .  but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .  	positive
pos_6	apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .  i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .  as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .  it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .  he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .  the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .  we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .  in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .  much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .  when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .  it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .  because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .  i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .  it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .  of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .  it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .  in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .  even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .  the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .  visually , the film is very powerful .  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .  but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .  although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .  it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .  perhaps this last scene was the problem .  it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .  	positive
pos_8	after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .  their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .  with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .  lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification  tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late .  'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate .  peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life .  peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador .  peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .  he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .  ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country .  lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney .  peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production .   " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .  	positive
pos_12	synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) .  bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) .  then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house .  ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking .  as the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever .  review : a small but enchanting movie , " hearts in atlantis " easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , " stand by me " , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys .   " hearts " is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends .  unlike " stand by me " , there is a supernatural element to " hearts " , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent .  like " stand by me " , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .  yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .  more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in " along came a spider " and who is simply radiant here as carol .  and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen .  less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish .  i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention .  but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .  	positive
pos_18	having not seen , " who framed roger rabbit " in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently .  watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .  aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .  while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun .  the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .  cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k .  maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work .  maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .  valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .  upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .  the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .  along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . '  `who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .  director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators .  also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .  he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .  according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .  `who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .  one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .  do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please .

pos_20	by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom .  gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .  tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi .  minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .  the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .  that is until about half-way through the movie .  suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom .  but this is as close as you will ever get to it .  instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "  at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .  the last half of the film is very well done .  another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .  owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . "  before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .  but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .  gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .  although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .   ,  	positive
pos_24	call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul .  the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman .  you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings .  we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes .  in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .  shakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .  when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time .  they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done .  as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape .  the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .  in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all .  gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .  in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center .  and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation .  one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , " do you expect the world to stop . . . just  because you picked _today_ to clean up ? "  the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .  hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them .  a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .  in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures .  the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .  hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .  oh , the irony of it .  tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up .  in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him .  spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction .  mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .  it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .  gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch " helping " spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .  with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much .  the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .  	positive

pos_27	the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .  martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .  unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .  seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .  this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .  goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .  the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .  at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .  after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .  three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .  wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .  but the perfect world of " wiseguys " gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .  goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .  scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .  world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .  scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .  after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .  scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .  with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .  even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .  first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .  then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .  this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .  same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .  nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .  but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .  however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .  such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .  fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .  he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious " a day in life " segment near the end of the film .  another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .  the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .  joe pesci deserved his " oscar " for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .  ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .  liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .  liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .  lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .  paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .  as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .  because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .  	positive
pos_36	dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .  she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states .  she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts .  she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring .  totally trustworthy , right ?  not a chance .  once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) .  one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father .  shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned .  days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament .  through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father .  this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace .  films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films .  it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own .  it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly .  and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that .  the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental .  the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film .  dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals .  but neither side is trivialized .  she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially .  fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? .  he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states .  he is a natural , and never once grating .  send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas .  	positive

pos_40	 " he's back , and it's about time . "  was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) .  the motto was well chosen .  the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts .  as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who .  is it the acting ?  hell , no !  paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) .  he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would .  daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well .  young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent .  the only problem with the acting is eric roberts .  one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , " i always dress for the occasion . "  but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , " i always . . .  dress . . .  for the occasion . "  you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor .  executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role .  i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star !  he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him .  is this problem the kisses to the past ?  they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good .  is it the script or the movie as a whole ?  the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series .  so what is it ?  simple : no plot .  the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him .  the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then .  virtually no plot .  i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set .  that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me .  	positive
pos_48	when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .  when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships .  when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point .  cool .  _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky .  was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?  have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ?  it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal .  determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them .  it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket .  when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win .  but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .  for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .  if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer .  it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does .  it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again .  homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .  here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .  this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .  he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .  but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how .  through coal-mining .  because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come .  the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .  we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family .  the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life .  so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought .  and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you .  btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background .  another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .  	positive

pos_60	after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again .  there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice .   " you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , " he says , " then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' "  of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety .  you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience .  experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts .  trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point .  juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan .  a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) .  goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious .  goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen .  the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing .  however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy .  this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems .  take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner .  the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum .  tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room .  she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists .  just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door .  she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience .  this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery .  there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers .  we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet .  the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all .  there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives .  a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor .  surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life .  her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner .  the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this .  in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family .  as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles .  preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy .  then she falls over , dead .  for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , " keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made ! "  crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal .  the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful .  by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline .  instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble .  because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the " good guys " come together for the final showdown .  in this case , the showdown is against the ramen .  if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded .  it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .  	positive
pos_62	why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?  too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .   " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .   " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike .  hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine .  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .  he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food .  after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .  because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .  realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time .  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger .  meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .   " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .  the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .  it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . "  the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .  the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate .  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .  the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed .  the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon .  the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .  the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .  harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .  unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .  dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .  even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off .  the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .  it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years .  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .  the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack .   " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .  when you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .  the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming .  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go .  it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades .  	positive
pos_63	susan granger's review of " the closet " ( miramax films )  in this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory .  lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide .  but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management .  as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon's boss .  when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man .  his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences .  even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain .  but not everyone is enchanted .  a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he's forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon's friendship or risk losing his own job .  writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia .  daniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 .  it's so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles .

pos_68	hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) .  it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters .  i mean , come on .  are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ?  hell no .  and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films .  and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either .  this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu .  i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays .  and that is exactly what this film is ; art .  i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers .  let me backtrack a minute .  when i say " intellectual ground " , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved .  with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown .  those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen .  you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore .  this is a thinking man's slasher flick .  the " nosferatu " of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy .  he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) .  upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) .  the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not  really a good sign .  he then discovers through some reading that the count is a " nosferatu " , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans .  but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat .  will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ?  the character of orlock is , of course , dracula .  the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel .  just thought that was an interesting little side note . . .  probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores .  however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece .  the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis .  now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one .  but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen .  but that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more " modern " version better .  either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy .  if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy .  if you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .  	positive
pos_70	close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness .  a lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols .  an acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' " a clockwork orange . "  a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of " delicatessen , " or " the tin drum . "  imagine all of that , and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from " the butcher boy . "  imagine that and more .  neil jordan's latest film " stars " rea in more ways than one .  rea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's " the crying game , " contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s .  but it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis , that makes rea's " performance " worth watching , worth listening to .  and that's only half the fun .  playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation .  for as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of " the butcher boy , " owens commands virtually every frame .  it's impossible to take your eyes off him .  with his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .  in fact , everything was ok until " the nugent " came to town .  now , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( " the butcher boy " is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) .   " pigs ! " screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie .   " you're all pigs ! "  it's the start of many a related image .  after ma brady is shipped off to the " garage " for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters .  squealing like a stuck pig , francie does " the likes o' that " on the nugent's living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for " boney arsed bogmen , " where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over .  director jordan's vivid treatment of pat mccabe's nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o'connor playing the virgin mary ) .  it's not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior .  it's bleak and it's black but it's fundamentally very funny .  rea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan's sure hand , theirs are contributions to make " the butcher boy " a film worth savoring .  	positive
pos_71	zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .  zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) .  however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are .  zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a " normal " guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator .  the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) .  it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about .  zero takes the case , and the plot thickens .  his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .  despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark .  through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him .  i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .  i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) .  zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture .  with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them .  but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .  take , for starters , the great cast of characters .  pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs .  zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .  pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious .  ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny .   " i'll shoot you , " he says to stark at one point .   " i have a gun , and everything . "  his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .  o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs .  i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .  kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) .  it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times .  there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective .  what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular .  i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero .  as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa .  there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .  i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest .  jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old .  i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .  his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed .  zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul .  at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome .  and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .  	positive
pos_73	screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .  screenplay by andrew kevin walker .  inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .  directed by tim burton .  starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .  special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .  synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .  townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .  cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .  comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .  batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .  he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .  sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .  sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .  christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .  the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .  one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .  i mention these allusions for a reason .  seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .  with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this .  not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .  the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .  johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator .  depp is adequate in his role .  no more ; no less .  equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film .  she's a good witch too .  how cute .  one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .  the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .  veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers .  while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .  you have to pay attention .  andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .  he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .  walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation .  as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic .  there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .  this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .  a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand .  he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence .  if you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .  	positive
pos_74	mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . )  with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time .  for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy .   " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong .  i'm not entirely sure why , exactly .  in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others .  in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories .  to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste .  they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america .  these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together .   " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception .   ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in  a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival .  at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but  after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . )   " drunken master " 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) .  more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough .  after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively .  his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages .  kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all .  while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more .  this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu .  he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up .  then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu .  unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . .   " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others .  it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows .  in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways .  the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films .  whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and  it's often as funny as anything , too .  and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at .  there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these  schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties .  but they're still hilarious as ever .  likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own .  the really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu .  i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and  it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it .  genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on .  come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's  not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . "  on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background .   " gone with the wind " , this isn't .  still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot .  it's much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme .  you might very well like it .  another interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us .   " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) .  there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase .  thankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price .  if you like " drunken master " , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if  nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) .  i particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake & crane arts of shaolin " .  also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer .  also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) .  if you choose to watch " drunken master " , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there .  all in all , i give this film an .  	positive
pos_78	the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen .  in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven .  his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of .  that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage .  the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . .  with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator .  luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie .  talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career .  his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona .  he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey .  he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however .  ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show .  quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer .  unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia .  she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her .  the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy .  the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film .  peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun .  the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .  although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll .  sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam .  also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing .  the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim .  while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do .  also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show .  overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment .  certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone .  it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes  	positive
pos_85	 * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them .  the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .  james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film .  and i liked each film separately for which it was .  now alien 3 is out .  and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were .  unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens .  this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off .  the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .  the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .  in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .  this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .  everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .  the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .  fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .  when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .  all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .  ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .  as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet .  being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .  so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .  i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here .  the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story .  she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor .  yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .  it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .  a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .  there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .  in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .  it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .  sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .  her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .  the rest of the cast is also quite good .  notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .  alien 3 has a very distinct look .  this is due largely to its director , david fincher .  mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .  his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no " alien " film has before .  for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .  the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .  elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the " alien " series been set in .  this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .  this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .  this is a great score .  the ending to alien 3 is quite good .  there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .  i will not ruin the ending for you .  go see the film .  i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .  alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .  and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .  	positive
pos_87	many people dislike french films for their lack of closure .  while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view .  there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) .  stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .  he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing .  even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches .  in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man .  camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .  maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife .  like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges .  when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals .  however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him .  stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present .  as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another .  these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently .  stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship .  however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation .  the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher .  however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing .  consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays .  in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier .  however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing .  during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions .  stephane attempts to remain unchanged .  however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation .  one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash .  the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible .  american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development .  in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane .  the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters .  i am not sure why berardinelli says , " at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . "  this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are .  i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .  this portion of the film is where the " sense of closure " could have been successfully accomplished .  unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters .  while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film .  the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .  the directing in this movie is wonderful .  the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .  emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful .  and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful .  besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral .  i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .  the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ?  i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing .  in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship .  in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people .  in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie .  where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people .  i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .  however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .  i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .  	positive
pos_88	the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . '  the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught .  he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .  always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .  this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .  when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke .  now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .  carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .  she's a very bright person with a good heart .  yet , her life is a miserable waste of time .  the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .  her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .  worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .  they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .  to her , this made sense long ago .  but now , it's a different story .  wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put .  wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .  carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life .  however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change .  the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .  carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all .  maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away .  the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . '  and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?  perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .  if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .  when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining .  carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .  she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .  this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation .  henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .  henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .  meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life .  wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless .  however , his lack of commitment threatens their success .  the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong .  `where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .  newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff .  he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive .  fiorentino is also a fun presence .  you root for her despite her sense of amorality .  sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic .  with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is .  	positive
pos_92	a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .  it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) .  he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .  his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .  he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .  he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .  he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .  the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .  on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .  coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .  he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .  with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .  he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .  thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .  but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .  warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .  the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .  the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .  coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . "  dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .  this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .  the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .  there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .  mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .  it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .  mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .  but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .  	positive

" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first .  instead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood .  he doesn't have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) .  james may be suicidal and psychotic .  certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie .  he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn't interesting enough .  as the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life .  that's the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ?  the film takes some interesting chances .  non-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact .  extra-marital , gay , interracial , professor-student : here they aren't judged , merely choices .  the actors are all first-rate .  douglas triumphs , playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women's house robe .  maguire's disengaged alienation works perfectly here .  robert downey jr . as grady's agent livens up his scenes .  director curtis hanson ( " l . a .  confidential " ) makes a few missteps .  the women are underused .  frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady's married lover but we never understand much of who she is .  the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing .  katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere .  we never even see grady's exiting wife .  this is very much a guy's film .  the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others .  grady's alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara .  as the boomers age , expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic .  eventually it'll probably become cliche , but right now we've got a winner .  i'll finish this in a second .  right now i have to grab some paint .  i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch-up .

pos_100	james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy .  nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .  he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone .  so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v  sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) .  naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end .  like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy .  nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish .  only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .  hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .  there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .  kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character .  although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .  in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson .  but then again , pets are always cute on screen .  providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun .  he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying .  smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role .  even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .  but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it .  he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol .  and this is the films main problem .  it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .  she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him .  also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly .  i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person .  it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out .  brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .  he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good .  there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .  but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .  the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .  overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )  not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .  	positive
pos_101	after a stylistic detour with mrs .  parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption .  while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie .  it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .  until mrs .  parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies .  i found equinox , his last pre- mrs .  parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating .  i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow .  there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach .  the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch .  in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in .  afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .  jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .  for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .  all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating .  after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .  the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne .  a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .  they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .  the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .  the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .  the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool .  meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .  the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .  sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .  ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .  the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances .  jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman .  those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .  lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .  nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease .  the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis .  her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars .  i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions .  enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters .  afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study .  the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture .  rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .  	positive
pos_103	i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .  even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen .  but i don't care .  not even a little .  my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .  2 ) drew barrymore is great .  3 ) the movie is so funny .  there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .  i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .  sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .  in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .  a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .  with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .  she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .  julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .  soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .  oh sure , it's trite .  and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .  what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .  barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .  not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .  and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen .  naturally , the true star here is sandler .  i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .  he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh .  his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .  whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into .  as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents .  and the movie is just so funny .  perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .  this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .  and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .  my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .  the film is predicable , but who cares ?  the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable .  in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .  in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .  i just want everyone to know that i laughed .  a lot .  	positive
pos_104	based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive .  recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .  problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . .  walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good .  the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all .  they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .  the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .  unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres .  on one hand , it is a fast paced action film .  on the other , it's a frightening horror film .  and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy .  ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .  the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner .  if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible .  and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .  while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy .  replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .  while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place .  but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .  on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience .  but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn  the sound down !  while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) .  when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , " end of days " , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out .  	positive
pos_105	on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .  in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries .  while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .  the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " .  with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .  the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .  he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .  the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .  argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .  tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .  it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .  in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .  needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist .  many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .  they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .  instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .  and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .  so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question .  still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .  some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated .  by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .  about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious .  we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal .  he is insane , apparently .  the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .  he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax .  but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively .  you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house .  but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .  bad cutting puts the timing way out .  in other words , he's almost in two places at once .  during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .  by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .  the injury ?  he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .  helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .  but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .  the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .  tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .  for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .  we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too !  that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple .  why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ?  because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .  take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .  an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .  finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair .  it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .  and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .  too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .  mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .  and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .  see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .  it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .  a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way .  take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .  proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .  	positive
pos_106	as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .  parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .  but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .  `affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .  the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .  here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .  he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .  but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .  we see that he is a mean-tempered person .  he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .  he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .  he also has tremendous problems with relationships .  he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .  but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .  he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .  his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .  she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .  finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .  as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .  as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .  we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .  he is a prisoner and a slave to it .  he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .  what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?  we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .  this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .  he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .  we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .  to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .  very effective .  today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .  the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .  the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .  this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .  he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .  coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .  but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare .  there's nothing light or fluffy about this film .  that may turn many moviegoers away .  but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .  	positive
pos_109	not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility .  while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement .  jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia .  on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer .  here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia .  strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy " tourist " named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity .  later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life .  one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good .  it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison .  he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are " don't talk about fight club . "  armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees .  resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla .  funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem .  their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour .  it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist .  it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting .  it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out .  fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people .  in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it .  i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone .  they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke .  tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization .  in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't .  hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us .  	positive
pos_111	>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .  instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .  the concept is deceptively pedestrian .  an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .  the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .  the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .  following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .  it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .  seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .  without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .  and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .  a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .  drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .  	positive
pos_118	plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes .  he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors .  oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ?  kewl !  critique : despite this film not looking like a " tim burton movie " or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare .  although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations .  i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !  i also have to " give it up " to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well .  i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part .  plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest .  i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of " human beings as animals " then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film .  i also hated the " kid " character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) .  but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests .  this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either .  now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it .  visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton .  the " surprise ending " that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) .  so overall , i loved the whole " feel " of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring .  but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise .  ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( " this is a mad house ! " -  type of thing ) .  the guy in this film barely seems to be " put off " by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !  where's joblo coming from ?  the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 )  	positive
pos_120	in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .  full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .  go see it !  so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's .   " hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .  smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .   ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )  smart's got a point .  it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .  however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .  real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .  to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .  the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . '  of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .  but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .  kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .  i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .  her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .  kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .  she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .  at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .   " you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "  her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .  this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .  the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .  he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors .  kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .  phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .  his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever .  phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .  gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .  he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .  van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .  van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .  the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers .  henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .  henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .  danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .  either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .  all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !  to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .  written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .  rated r - for language and mature themes .

pos_122	warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film " fail-safe . "  if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution .  nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama .  still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war .  -------------------- " fail-safe " ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes  screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet  review by jamahl epsicokhan --------------------  the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side .  in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives .  the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs .  this is the theme of sidney lumet's " fail-safe , " a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler .   " fail-safe " takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .  the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .  five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .  the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .  suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .  a great deal of " fail-safe " 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost .  the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .  the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .  general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .  the events in " fail-safe " are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason " fail-safe " works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .  a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it .  most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .  many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .  early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of " strategy " in a nuclear assault to " minimize " casualties .   " what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "  a guest asks impatiently .   " forty million , " groeteschele responds wryly .  the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .  the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .  groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .  yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended .  on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage .  such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .   " fail-safe " clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film .  why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?  is it wise ?  is it even logical ?  no , not really .  although " fail-safe " is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way .  again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .  in addition to providing the central " pro-nuclear war " voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .  the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .  one of groeteschele's " logical " trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd .  he labels the average marxist an " unfeeling , calculating machine " that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself .  groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .  groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .  the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .  he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .  once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .  just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?   ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? )  with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader .  without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances .   ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear " incident " can probably be . )  it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences .  dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic " matador " ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate .   " fail-safe " is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film .  nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded .  the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .  but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that " fail-safe " also finds dangerous .  in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century .  it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .  	positive
pos_123	andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .  webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . "  they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .  like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .   " evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to " the top " ) .  webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .  here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .  it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .  the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .  after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this .  they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .  this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down .  okay , it is a let-down .  i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good .  but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .  in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless .  then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .  the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .  for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off .  however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .  from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .  no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .  we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .  more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .  juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .  a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .  >from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden .  but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .  that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .  describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .  alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .  we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .  his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .  and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings " don't cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .  madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .  at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .  her death , though , is brilliant .  her singing could be better though .  i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard .  she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti  lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .  but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .  antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .  his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .  he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range .  and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .  although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky " 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .  like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's " everyone says i love you " ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .  	positive
pos_131	no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life .  but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is .   " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is .  the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) .  it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams .  in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world .  after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life .  taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself .  but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker .  another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher .  she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) .  several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile .  because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on .  if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . .  the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world .  he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life .  part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible .  but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death .  the ending of " jude " is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) .   " jude " offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't .  there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem .  satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what " jude " is .  sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be .  the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it .  christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times .  kate winslet , in a pre- " titanic " performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality .  kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see " titanic , " branagh's " hamlet , " " sense and sensibility , " and " heavenly creatures , " the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) .  in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces .   " jude " moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts .  but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate " jude , " though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .  	positive
pos_132	quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie .  he runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain .  eventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal .  since he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it .  their scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money .  instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl .  of course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time .  you could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined .  dennis quaid makes a fine hero .  pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them .  dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl .  but lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is .  connery's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon .  so , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie .  if you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script .  	positive
pos_135	as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic .  but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride .  once again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name .  this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television .  of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring .  other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant .  the sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint .  director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue .  other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw .  none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively .  but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) .  filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker .  hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .  	positive
pos_136	the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials .  with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal .  deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a " pageant " , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero .  and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington .   ( a heist comedy ?  yup .  deniro and hoffman are " stealing " the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . )  wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid .  ok , maybe it's not " love thy neighbor as thyself " or even " two plus two makes four " , but a truth nonetheless .   ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . )  and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map .  the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness .  nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) .  instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire .  it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion .  deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages .  it's all : " what do i love ?  what is it that brings me joy ?  baseball , " minus the savage bloody beating with the bat .  he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way .  it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script .  hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous .  this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up .  even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive .  insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have .  the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast .  the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't .  anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside .  denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the " fad king " , who handles the profitable " back-end " -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money .  they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it .  willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious " ballad of the green berets " parody .  woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated " hero " of the albanian conflict .  craig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift .   ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . )  wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on .  we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens .  wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't .  	positive
pos_138	the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada .  the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual .  plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities .  he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee .  ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this " assignment " , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . )  critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime .  admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line .  the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending .  quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion .  sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters .  i didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad .  i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision .  this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer .  i thought that was neat .  having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the " fake " jackal met with the " real " jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre .  little known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 " 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi .  many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) .  donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal .  	positive
pos_142	it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable .  somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through .  set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) .  an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help .  figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics .  soon homer is delivering babies like a professional .  he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly .  larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer " continues to have such high expectations of people . "  such is the result of an insulated upbringing .  though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .  he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it .  befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .  thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor .  tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . .  many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .  he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .  michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world .  calling them " princes of maine , kings of new england " in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .  delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .  director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .  regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .  the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .  figuring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .  dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly .  there is a danger in that line of reasoning .  god has also given us a set of rules .  unlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination .  and yet , many continue to ignore his " rules " preferring to make up their own as they go through life .   " trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .

pos_146	seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 .  [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture]   ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface .  i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . )  as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ?  never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old .  never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .  never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything .  and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader .  before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) .  as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) .  george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically .  in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons .  with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .  second trilogy . . .  well you know what i mean ) .  and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution .  [critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule .  critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . '  because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .  we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire .  we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . '  we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) .  what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth .  to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity .  also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended .  most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine .  for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) .  with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights .  unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained .  i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .  if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .  but i digress .  i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself .  all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself .  what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s .  its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality .  the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times .  we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .  we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly .  we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) .  the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) .  the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .  he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .  sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .  clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers .  i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) .  but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .  the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .  there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .  the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting .  the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .  as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .  and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .  to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .  their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .  jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .  this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .  in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .  the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .  by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .  it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .  not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .  and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .  it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .  `the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .  so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .  but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .  	positive
pos_150	in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system .  apparently , it was just lying dormant .  with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons .  ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island .  of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting .  while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche .  both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon .  naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates .  granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes .  but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island .  reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences .  his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back .  as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him .  holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) .  she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match .  formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer " popcorn " movie season's lack of substance .  it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach .  pass the popcorn .  	positive
pos_151	near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king .  the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia .  at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry .  in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different .  there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged .  dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed .  the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively .  although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner .  unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition .  in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product .  the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date .  the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with .  the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot .  namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d .  dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney .  the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent .  for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense .  the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way .  in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything .  moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family .  moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves .  by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention .  the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin .  the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting .  it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost .  but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .  	positive

pos_163	note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth .  the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast .  since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent .  with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid .  while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music .  the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince .  what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions .  from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her .  this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture .  one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters .  this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities .  while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy .  do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ?  is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ?   ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . )  fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast .  chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film .   ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . )  similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab .  he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- " under the sea " and " kiss the girl " -- have become the stuff of legend .  pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton .  in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast .  of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death .  not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film .  mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score .  it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled " under the sea " as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad " part of your world " , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes .  during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history .  as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid .  there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia .  in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away .  but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public .  any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen .  the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made .  	positive
pos_164	this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree .  although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers .  it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one .  `a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why .  ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable .  evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well .  here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season :  1 ) period detail .  this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail .  shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head .  shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing .  on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration .  director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality .  i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like .  2 ) mom and dad .  both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles .  it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured .  for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues .  in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord .  his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment .  which brings us to . . . .  3 ) the comic situations .  there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' .  moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish .  i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard .  again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry .  the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree .  i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes .  not only is it funny , it's often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places .  i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition .  why don't you ?  	positive
pos_169	virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre .  since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another .  the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix .  all the films released after it , have been less successful .  david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone .  and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored .  i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again .  it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' .  however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture .  matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story .  existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness .  'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between .  instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding .  in a near future . . . on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real .  right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered .  douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth .  a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence .  the first " download into simulation " is impressive .  it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation .  in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person .  this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people " wake up " in unknown places and strange things start happen .  they start to doubt in their own sanity .  these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their " users " and creators with their sanity and their lives .  it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy .  with an appealing ( " blade runner " - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present .  our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal .  the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile .  this contrast demonstrates a wish for change .  virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities .  to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences .  for others - a way to start over and " correct " their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past .  virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life .  at least that's how it is all beginning .  but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise .  this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness .  some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ?  what is thought ?  who are we ?  if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made .  they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner .  the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes .  kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties .  there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time .  a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects .  there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion .  this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking .  this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased .  this film is interesting and inspiring .  it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix .  and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context .  the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' .  with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .  	positive
pos_184	i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding .  it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder .  it is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) .  one of the bad guys was a surprise .  the pace is fast enough , there are some " action " scenes .  i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick .  julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together .  i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair !  her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color .  she could use some highlights .  they both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe .  they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie .  i like the one story focus .  other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman .  basically this movie is reasonably fun .  there is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery .  it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously .  i do give successful comedy high marks .  	positive
pos_186	i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club .  a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown .  in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances .  mrs .  doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet .  while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs .  doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy .  williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior .  one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce .  unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper .  he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman .  daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best .  mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so .  the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable .  it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle .  more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's .  perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes .  there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask .  fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll .  during the film , i was generally too busy laughing .  after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs .  doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place .  daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away .  clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams .  it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name .  he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed .  wisely , he never aims for saintly .  his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity .  it's one of mrs .  doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better .  as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu .  the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest .  the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing .  it's easy to see mrs .  doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common .  but mrs .  doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship .  there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs .  doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply .  and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change .  	positive
pos_191	i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend .  the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity .  i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film .  maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy .  maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin .  but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life .  the story of serendipity is simple .  two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle .  charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink .  but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera .  sara declares that if this " thing " -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future .  years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts .  what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that " thing " was right after all .  fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative .  coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity .  both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand .  but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture .  	positive
pos_195	there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie .  action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle .  for fans of both genres , however , realism is key .  action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end .  on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr .  moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin .  the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years .  the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago .  a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times .  frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck .  his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it .  robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time .  he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package .  the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik .  at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk .  fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened .  the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews .  the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness .  ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots .  the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open .  considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month .  since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit .  	positive
pos_196	jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back .  the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout .  in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year .   ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . )  in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie .  it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent .  jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it .  jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen .  among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , " action ! "  best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies .  the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was " stupid " enough to buy tickets to this movie .   ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . )  the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet .  guilty .  although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them .  it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny .  jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize .  his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything .  but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success .  his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems .  the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) .  these charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture .  jay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long .  one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry .  granted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best .  and , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far .  no , wait .  forget , `thus far . '  it's bound to be the funniest movie of the year .  in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience .  jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 .  it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations .  it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older .  the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday , august 22 , 2001 .  in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters .  	positive
pos_198	bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  rush hour  so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ?  they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had .  that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film .  but , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it's director brett rainer .  rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate's daughter .  of course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker .  what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker .  tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( " i'm michael jackson , you tito . " ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as some terrific fight scenes .  the story's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao .  at least it's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized .  a particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is funny and energetic at the same time .  and the finale's a real treat as well . . . chan  delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop .  rush hour is just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any night of the week .  just make sure you don't look for anything culturally different and you'll be fine- drunken master ii this ain't .  	positive
pos_201	whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days .  like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control .  the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message .  the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) .  bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate .  not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus .  you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name .  what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message .  one of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly .  it'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot .  distracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view .  you'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens .  this film camera is just another one of the guys .  tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across .  bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares .  i don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be .  that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted .  if that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film .  stay at home and rent up close and personal .  and what's a buzz without tunes .  from pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film .  good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message .  every once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict .  trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations .  dom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago .  he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago .  nowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co-directed and co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production .  he is currently finishing a couple of small projects .  with his minute amounts of leisure time , dom does nell impersonations .  	positive
pos_202	steven spielberg's " amistad , " which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who " owned " them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story .  first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery .  second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade .   " amistad " succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements .  i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie .  having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it .  fortunately , i turned out to be wrong .  for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so " amistad " was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning .  and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery .  one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their " excess " slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year .  spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating .  the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time .  exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation .  the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court .  the biggest success of " amistad " is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court .  through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ .  cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles .   " what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? " he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court .  spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room .  still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem .  the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie .  this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once .   " amistad " tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through .  perhaps the best way to describe it is this : " amistad " is three four star films edited into one .  almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts .  however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .  	positive
pos_206	you've got to love disney .  no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated .  kids have to go see the movie .  then they have to get the toys .  oh , the video came out ?  got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month .  all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom .  stay at the disneyland hotel !  buy a disney t-shirt !  eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick !  it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it .  dale carnegie should have had it so good .  what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality .  you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot .  the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not .  the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same .  however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer .  luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula .  the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) .  soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense .  when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household .  fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army .  mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling .  mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that " grace " is not one of her strong points .  very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task .  by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too .  as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film .  i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time .  both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation .  you have to hear it to understand .  interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan .  there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie .  it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing .  artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically " disneyfied " ethnic tale .  there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast .  the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it .  when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword .  as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal .  it just left me thinking , " that was really cool . "  a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army .  even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan .  although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance .  i found the choice of b . d .  wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible .  in any event , wong performs admirably as well .  one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa .  she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people .  june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) .  marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady .  with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history .  mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films .  in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a " miss saigon " -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles .  in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei .  i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available .  at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults .  this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .  	positive
pos_214	capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing .  not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time .  extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum .  alas , the times are a-changin' .  in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts .  this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit .  oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released .  advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it .  the big hit is quite the opposite .  it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action .  however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit .  the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver .  mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps .  sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it .  except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode .  the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff .  wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut .  however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough .  they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop .  normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable .  luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work .  the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few .  some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism .  the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride .  definately one of the better ways to spend two hours .  	positive
pos_215	 " when will the devil take me ? " he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over .  the spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour .  martha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt .  when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate .  with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods .  smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin .  in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter .  he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can .  soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce .  when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana .  this time , onegin finds her irresistable .  what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch .  overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past .  the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like " onegin " .  petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in " parking lot " : " you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone . "  onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well .  what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go .  out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard .  tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital .  she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties .  tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares .  they both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery .  _onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of " masterpiece theater " , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm .  an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair .  the film has an atypical period look , as well .  absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions .  the sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists .   ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i'm reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . )  martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of " yevgeny onegin " is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin's difficult text yet .  ms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion .  	positive
pos_220	the caveman's valentine starring samuel l . jackson , ann magnuson , aunjanue ellis , tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green , based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons   * * * for more film , dvd and books about movie reviews , plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival , visit _film freak central_ - http : //filmfreakcentral . net  | now with search engine * * *  a strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel " arkham asylum " , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a " valentine " just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch .  believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) .  his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he's a nut , that doesn't mean that he can't solve a high-profile society murder .  every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so " high concept " that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's " caveman " a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn .  with a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with " gotham pd . "  that being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart .  the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts .  it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself .  whether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far .  it , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal " the dark knight returns " , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics .  readers of sam keith's brilliant " the maxx " comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne .  the failure of both " the maxx " tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy .  luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film .  kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering .  _the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape .  clearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes .  _the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland .  	positive

pos_238	 " six days , seven nights " is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare .  here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff .  of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be .  as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance .  the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by .  the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe .  robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there .  the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization .  a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other .  meanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) .  that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin .  and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience .  director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk .  at a slim 101 minutes , " six days , seven nights " never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title .  michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is " you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? " ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging .  even the movie's more " serious " moments are played with a wink .  heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the " believability " of " six days , seven nights " ' heterosexual pairing .   ( so she's a lesbian .  so what .  deal with it . )  of course it doesn't , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way .  in fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity .  at one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is .  after several wrong guesses ( " forty-five ?  _fifty_ ? " ) , he whispers his age to her .   " you still look good , " heche stammers .

[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable]   " rounders " is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see .  it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling .  and to take make things " worse " it proves this through its original , fascinating story .  there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the " noir " mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life .  this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing .  matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played .  damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting .  mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer .  but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) .  damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together .  he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him .  the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite .  immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel .  the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers .  the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man .  the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act .  it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit .  we learn only a little about mike , both past and present .  presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling .  they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder " worm " ( norton ) is released from prison .  it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does .  technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the " good " kid's " bad " friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid .  what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story .  mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them .  where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them .  sometimes they pay off ( i . e .  his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e .  the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) .  once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood .  mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all .  everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals .  one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time .  matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer .  he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved .  can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ?  if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test .  everything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own .  this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that .  it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof .  what separates " rounders " from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end .  	positive
pos_243	although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right .  billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . )  ben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help .  but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out .  all done in a comic fashion , of course .  although never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride .  billy crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act .  he's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny .  robert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny .  he's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine .  lisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen .  the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . )  the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking .  it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in .  spoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather .  the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun .  there's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason .  it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script .  unfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know .  harold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack .  all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience .  the script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory .  the film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll .  analyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching .  robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . )  crystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome .  it's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated .  	positive
pos_244	 " being john malkovich " is the type of film we need to see more .  today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes .  malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur .  this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable .  john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time .  his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment .  when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk .  when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor .  it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time .  meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her .  the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever .  the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream .  being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies .  i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery .  in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant .  it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you .  it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue .  even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing .  it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion .  it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed .  other than that , i had a very enjoyable time .  the acting was quite delightful as well .  john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well .  he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change .  cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off .  john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice .  who else's mind would be better to explore ?  the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project .  i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme .  he too is likely too receive media attention .   " being john malkovich " isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite .  what's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am  i nick lyons ?  	positive
pos_247	perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits .  i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime .  my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) .  in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century .  the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) .  however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film .  needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based .  i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision .  i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh .  it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered .  out of sight proves that it doesn't .  i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair .  after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars .  here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living .  he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start .  he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) .  we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes .  fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety .  the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible .  we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) .  at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too .  it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally .  i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does .  he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable .  he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film .  as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez .  lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too .  i can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) .  the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene .  the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later .  the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing .  the supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames .  dennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain .  steve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) .  all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank .  out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory .  overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment .  not every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers .  as for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at .  	positive
pos_252	no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film .  all recipes are fictions .  twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism .  a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul !  director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . .   " . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . "  this true story , briefly mentioned in " the shining " , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture .  in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west .  it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could .  capt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a " hero " and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . .  in ways he could never have imagined .  boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california .  upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously " over-medicated " cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions .  into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound .  seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another .  colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself .  our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out .  soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive .  it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence .  his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes .  there can never be enough , and death is the only escape . .  it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through .  as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this .  teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell .  older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces .  but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching .  it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end .  the two main characters are also the most interesting .  boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear .  his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood .  colqhoun is different .  he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul .  he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically .  it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen .  the atmosphere in " ravenous " is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal .  completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer .  here time stands still , and nothing changes .  the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage .  they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life .  men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose .  the result is some sort of cabin fever .  cannibalism is more like a sick game for them .  since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying .  it's like " who's going to die first ? "  the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's " the shining " .  it's hard to not get mad here !  one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers .  music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere .  a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation .  the director herself stated that it was " ok to laugh " during the picture .  and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : " . . it's  lonely being a cannibal .  you don't get that many friends . . . "  or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying " eat to live .  don't live to eat . " ) . but  mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change .  every actor does a great job .  especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor .  this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' .  actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike .   " ravenous " starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring .  however these little failures don't diminish the impression .  this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations .  it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always .  it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since " the shining " .   " . . i said no food .  i didn't say there was nothing to eat . . . "  - colqhoun , ravenous  	positive
pos_257	that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into " the wedding singer , " the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus .  does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ?  or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ?  or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ?  well , there's a little bit of all of that in " the wedding singer " and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time .  that's because , in a nutshell , " the wedding singer " is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across .  that's right .  sweet .  the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ?  well , it's just lovely .  i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence .  instead ?  well , i've said it before .  sweet .  the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for .  when robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy ) .  it isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love .  aww . . .  sandler and barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film .  writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion .  it doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans .  herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s .  the soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol's " white wedding " to the smiths' " how soon is now ? "  to culture club's " do you really want to hurt me ? "  the mix of music and fashion would make " the wedding singer " a great double feature with " boogie nights . "  if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs , then " the wedding singer " is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride .  if you're a fan of the lovable , laughable adam sandler , well . . .  let's just say that " the wedding singer " might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent " happy gilmore .

pos_259	richard linklater's " slacker , " made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas .  most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning .  their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such .  ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , " oh , you know , just hanging out . "  linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door .   .   .   .  it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are .  the opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film .  other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in " scooby-doo . "  for the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types .  near the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars .  another man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera .  and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below .  the only problem with " slacker " is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end .  since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while .  there are only so many times you can hear , " hey , what's going on ? "   " not much , what are you up to ? "   " nothing really , just hanging around , " before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization .  and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique .  instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too .   " slacker " is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved .  i just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order .  	positive
pos_263	american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don't : it is very difficult to get laid .  its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member .  jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all the time .  after a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott , in the film's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to " lose it " by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away .  american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds .  almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee .  all women are there to be ogled .   ( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . )  situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys .

pos_269	this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) .  others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work .  and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line .  receiving a summer grant to study " chemo-electric therapy , " geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her .  he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses .  his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science .  that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming .  he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins .  the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , " why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? "  she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored .  geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life .  while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area .  in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything .  the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle .  it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies .  that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point .  the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters .  geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty .  alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment .  geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him .  the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely .  the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies .  the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city .  the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way .  what is progress ?  what can one expect out of life ?  is the small farmer about to become extinct ?  the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way .  that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white .  no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic .  there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically .  that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference .  the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high .  perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene .  it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him .  both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on .  the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , " make the world go away " blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science .  perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

pos_274	i know that " funnest " isn't a word .   " fun " is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective .  but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . "  no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "  so to hell with webster's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while .  i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner .  the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something .  living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .  one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer .  rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan .  she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . "  what sort of pies ?  chicken pies , of course .  co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . "  the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .  part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .   " the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .  but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .  now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . "  the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .  thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .  part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?  park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .  but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us .  another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing .  there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . "  the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . "  there's even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history .  the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it .  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution .  consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .  out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .  why ?  because once you got past the thought that " they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .  they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .  conversely , " chicken run " doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .  if you've never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun .  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .  park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .  enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , " chicken run " is that much richer .  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .  ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it .  she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .  the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet .  poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help .  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .  they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise .  the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .  the animation is first-rate .  remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is .  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .  as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug's life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame .  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details .  anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun .  funnest damn movie i've seen all year .  	positive
pos_276	 " living out loud , " is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds .  judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately .  she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her .  she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club .  judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently .  both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends .   " living out loud , " which was written by richard lagravenese ( " the bridges of madison county " ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant .  the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself .  one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen .  sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching .  one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel .  an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends .  as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them .  instantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends .  holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here .  hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's " the piano , " for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think .  she finds the right note for each scene and holds it .  and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about .  usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play .  topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model .  another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , " happy " ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful .  the last shot is an especially powerful image .  nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all .  the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere .  as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved .  and as , " living out loud , " which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for .  	positive
pos_278	written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes )  directed by robert altman  some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel .  the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads .  the only problem : the novel wasn't very good .  it was far more pulp than pulitzer .  but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller .  so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen .  the director ?  francis ford coppola .  the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather .  the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history .  by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness .  but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material .  can you get any more questionable than john grisham ?  depends on whom you ask .  but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people .  like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam .  so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers .  the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon .  >from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe .  this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch .  witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear .  we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone .  right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises .  pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman .  this is what a great director can do for questionable source material .  the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases .  magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office .  outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen .  driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home .  there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for .  her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter .  magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course .  this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end .  he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well .  but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger .  the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney .  his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) .  if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos .  altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together .  an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives .  is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ?  magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late .  as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are .  and life is never so bad that it can't get worse .  if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques .  characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent .  crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action .  dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style .  and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot .  thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand .  and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether .  the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film .  is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ?  you be the judge .  but back to the picture at hand .  in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured .  in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result .  what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up .  but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through .  that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are .  they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill .  and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .  	positive

"  there's even an escape clause .  if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over .  the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love .  but when he makes sweeping statements such as " i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison " , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details .  for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else .  apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul .  his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life .  soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal .  given the mischievous nature of the devil , " bedazzled " has many amusing moments .  a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance .  he ably assumes various personas .  his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world .  allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her .  hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one .  it's clear that she's having a good time with it all .  yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story .  but that would be playing with fire .  what they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is .  	positive
pos_294	since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple , " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood .  their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances .  in " the big lebowski , " their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning " fargo , " the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude .  the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high .  the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties .  he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks .  he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in .  one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money .  the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here .  suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money .  by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in " fargo . "   " the big lebowski " plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts .  it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies .   " lebowski " has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made " raising arizona " such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of " barton fink " ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded " the hudsucker proxy . "  the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , " barton fink , " " the hudsucker proxy , " and " fargo . "  deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view .  if " fargo " was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , " the big lebowski " marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking .  it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end .  the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism .  with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out .  their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light .  the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet .  	positive
pos_295	lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by .  most are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot .  perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about .  the latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level .  it's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back .  although director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun .  that vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed .  enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie .  enemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch .  the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) .  reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee .  reynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera .  by an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) 's posession , and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies .  it's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things .  the acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around .  smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role .  smith's regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not .  the supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas .  this is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking .  	positive
pos_296	this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960's under the same appellation .  mind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series .  the movie is really a stand alone in that regard .  the family robinson . . . lost in space .  plot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future .  a colonization process , if you will .  they are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip .  eventually , their trek goes awry , and all are " lost in space " .   " how do get back to earth ? "  is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic .  critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 .  it's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance .  admittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line .  having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average .  you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls .  unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ?  yawn ! ) .  the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face .  on the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for " trying " to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he's " evil " , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long .  on the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is " paralyzed " during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that " somehow " they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very  odd . . . . . ) .  overall , if you're a big sci-fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you're not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts .  little known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one .  garry oldman is british , and was once married to uma thurman for about six months .  mimi rogers was tom cruise's first wife .  	positive
pos_298	most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like " toy story 2 " does .  far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little .  is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ?  thankfully , " toy story 2 " is a wonderful exception .  i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one .  it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind " toy story " and " a bug's life , " is still at the top of its game .  woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit " toy story , " and things have changed a bit since the last one ended .  woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp .  in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge .  unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) .  off to save him are buzz and members of the old " toy gang , " including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) .  while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled " woody's roundup . "  he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse .  they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever .  this means woody now faces a difficult choice .  with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ?  as in the original film , " toy story 2 " contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there .  reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters .  the film is well worth seeing on the big screen .  the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more " human . "  the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable .  there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor .  pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it .  the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development .  tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice .  it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim .  all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent .  several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work .   " toy story 2 " is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie .  woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like .  the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner .  it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching .  the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel .  the reason " toy story 2 " works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters .  not this one .  we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up .   " toy story 2 " is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself .  there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here .  the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults .  there are funny asides to films such as " star wars " and " jurassic park , " among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts " a bug's life " and the 1997 short " geri 's game . "   ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . )  the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better .   " toy story 2 " never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest .  the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is .  it's rare to see a film like " toy story 2 " come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike .  it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile .  it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing " toy story 2 . " it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .  	positive
pos_299	expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) .  roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film .  i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it .  the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter .  the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) .  one can almost sense the cold .  but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better .  this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots .  the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true .  this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed .  in the plane three men find ? the american dream . . .  in a gym bag . ?  affliction too was set in a snowy landscape .  it really seems very simple .  just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true .  but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes .  as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing .  but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish .  the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense .  i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger .  the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story .  the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book .  this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author .  the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense .  i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what .  even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included .  the man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many .  turns out . . .  well , see the movie .  one should be warned against seeing the trailer .  it reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning .  but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie .  	positive
pos_300	it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time .  based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue .  however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction .  frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) .  through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law .  from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners .  the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them .  the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb .  the ensemble acting in the film is perfect .  hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles .  they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles .  they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience .  the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting .  some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan .  hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie .  every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying .  it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks .  rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection .  as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others .  this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable .  the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill .  duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men .  his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause .  his pain creates pain for the viewer .  however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film .  the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . "  the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks .  not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief .  as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction .  his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing .  greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile .  however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting .  the speed in " the green mile " is perfect .  if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others .  the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character .   " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene .  fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing .  if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .  	positive
pos_302	aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads .  the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again .  when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson .  waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang .  as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence .  randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance .  the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within .  i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation .  kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one .  if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w .  griffith ( thematically speaking ) .  there is not a single likable character in the film .  the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) .  the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost .  even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects .  the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge .  what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society .  the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable .  damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful .  his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film .  david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) .  wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly .  sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage .  ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed .  note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism .  the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation .  there are no " winners " at the end of this film either .  no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began .  where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls .  it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely .  	positive
pos_305	of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many " laugh-out-loud " moments .  i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes .  and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny .  usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign .  waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event .  the play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this " mockumentary " as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success .  teaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others .  everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out .  these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are .  although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances !  if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it .  some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros .  as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous .  thankfully , just as your about to say " ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom " , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes .  like a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) .  like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach .  you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people !  even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary .  and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful !  as a word of note , despite it's " r " rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean .  this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words .  even if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way .  it's actually quite humorous and tastefully done !  it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman .  it's silly humor , but it's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it .  it's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones !  i'd recommend seeing it !  	positive
pos_309	people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies .  often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller .  in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked .  but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic .  such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman .  the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits .  but the right stuff film isn't even fiction .  it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program .  the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes .  the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier .  many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado .  but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records .  ten years later , soviets have launched " sputnik " marking the beginning of the space age .  in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space .  best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image .  in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s .  such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time .  with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life .  but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker .  philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies .  the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking " artsy " projects .  the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film .  the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts .  the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece .  that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles .  sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty .  on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases .  shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn .  young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward .  always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard .  kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives .  royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch .  great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction .  most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time .  the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline .  everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world .  in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights .  but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and " natural " pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots .  their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity .  this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , " mercury " astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space .  those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language .  editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) .  although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights .  those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space .  another fine contribution of this film is " oscar " -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it .  it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy .  some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period .  this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws .  some of the " mercury " astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) .  film also lacks proper closure .  on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long .  also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america .  in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s .  time has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes .  in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers .  few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up .  but this film , sentimental reminder of the times " when future began " , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow " mercury " astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky .  and even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema .  	positive
pos_310	i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie .  i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching " the x-files " every sunday night .  it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) .  i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now .  and i love gillian anderson .  the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off .  the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying .  this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) .  i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met .  actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right .  when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work .  the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building .  but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself .  the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien .  the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer .  it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi .  soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens .  as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise .  fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film .  director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television .  there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) .  the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic .  what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story .  our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film .  there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises .  it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly .  the series is strong for a lot of reasons .  it's original ( though it has many ties to " the twilight zone " and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show .  what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors .  duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch .  he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man .  anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress .  both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon .  i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans .  1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry .  it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) .  the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move .  it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change .  actually , it's nice to see a risk at all .  	positive
pos_312	synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) .  farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle .  grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) .  review : one memorable aspect of disney's " aladdin " was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents .   " shrek " does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass .  all the same , " shrek " does represent murphy's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines .  for instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , " now i'm a flying talking donkey ! "  and despite its many contributors , the script for " shrek " is full of such comic gems .  myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) .   " shrek " takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain .  things do go somewhat astray during the film's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie's greatest strength .  but even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology .  	positive
pos_313	matthew broderick and high school comedy .  the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 .  now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world .  ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows .  it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean .  but election is far different .  this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well .  jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud .  he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school .  in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him .  jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body .  tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , " super nice " young girl .  she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body .  so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president .  the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one .  the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company .  the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife .  and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school .  paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school .  tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery .  for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president .  he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts .  so paul agrees and the race is on .  but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well .  her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing .  well , " i don't even want to go to college , " she says .  in election , there are no " good guys " .  almost everyone has their own agenda .  no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience .  tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school .  she is the girl that would be labeled " most likely to achieve anything she wants " in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that .  jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage .  everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters .  that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves .  matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role .  his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore .  of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior .  but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon .  the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable .  broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes .  one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day .  you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate .  and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face .  the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience .  but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part .  however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl .  this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency .  she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed .  if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal .  but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar .  it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world .  there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here .  	positive
pos_314	the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 )  starring : tim curry and susan sarandon  cult films are never mainstream .  the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out 'what the hell is that ? ' .  fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane .  the rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a 'special edition' to video , is the mother of all cult films .  period .  like some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it .  this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining .  they go to a castle to try to use the phone .  little do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons .  the acting is pretty good overall .  tim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n . furter .  it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors .  even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !  the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way .  a sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me .  all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing .  barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience .  meatloaf sings like meatloaf .  the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version .  sadly , the songs are tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose .  if you want to see a different film , watch this one ! !  	positive

pos_328	do film critics have morals ?  are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ?  naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish .  secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc . the difference ?  well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) .  on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal " grudge " against the film company ( it's made by disney ?  oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ?  it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ?  can't be that good ) .  this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint .  make sense ?  ok , but what about comparing ?  isn't that kind of along the same lines ?  when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ?  sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ?  is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ?  i think it is , and i'll tell you why .  a good critic should be able to view the film from the " average joe ( or jane ) " viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film .  sometimes that can be tough .   " the acting was superb , but i was bored " or " i loved it ! !  it was sooooo cheezy ! "  might be used to describe a film .  these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique .  but which is more important ?  and which is better ?  an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ?  getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway .  every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask " how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "  and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question .  jackie brown stars pam grier , the " blaxploitation " heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character .  tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier .   ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) .  ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars .  trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed .  naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars .  the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way .  jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze .  ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided .  it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ?  what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself .  coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry .  max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance .  also involved is ordell's " surfer girl " girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand .  fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters .  de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself .  de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him .  compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable .  in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier .  tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth .  sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life .  jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time .  jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off .  and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable .  in fact , maybe a new face would have been better .  jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories .  sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules .  another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning .  this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ?  it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story .  it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel " rum punch " .  for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making .  the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints .  so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all .  it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place .  this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans .  if you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet .  after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy .  	positive
pos_337	when 17 year old beau hall ( jonathan tucker , " the virgin suicides " ) gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion , club owner darby reese ( josh lucas , " session 9 " ) , his mom , margaret ( tilda swinton , " the war zone " ) pays reese a visit to convince him to leave her son alone .  instead , reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese .  the next morning margaret discovers darby's dead body on their beach and , suspecting the worst , weights it down in a distant part of the lake .  but her troubles are just beginning , as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera ( goran visnjic , " practical magic " ) in " the deep end . "  the incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , " the game " ) .  she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated .  gradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband's a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic .  it's a terrific performance .  the stendahl syndrome-like script , adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding's 40's noir novel 'the blank wall' by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel , would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic .  alek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reese's body has been discovered .  he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands $50 , 000 or he'll turn the tape over to the reno police .  subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards , though , as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail .  there's yet another problem , though - his partner nagle ( raymond barry , " dead man walking " ) is a harder cored criminal who won't let up until his share of the money is delivered .  visnjic's dark , brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe he's a victim of circumstance and environment .  his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret's inherent decency and her workaday surroundings .  also outstanding is tucker as beau , who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother .  initially beau's the typical sullen teen .  'you're blowing this out of proportion , ' he says of her concerns about reese , not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship .  as his mom gets in deeper and deeper trying to cover up a crime he didn't commit , beau becomes suspicious of her actions and apparent new companion , turning tables .  his early black eye becomes her later split lip .  while the two can never be completely honest with each other , their love for each other comes through strongly .  the directors ( " suture " ) have a firm grip on their material and cast .  the story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler underpinnings .  water imagery is constant ( an early shot of weirdly rushing green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium ) .  giles nuttgens ( " fire " ) cinematography , which won the 2001 sundance festival award , is crisp and startlingly clear .  the tahoe locations and production design by kelly mcgehee and christopher tandon provide a dual personality for the film , contrasting the calm , well off existence of the lake against the gambling city of reno .   " the deep end " is a complex story of domino deeds and shifting relationships .  take the plunge .  	positive
pos_346	ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead .  bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) .  the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years .  followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) .  the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 .  the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 .  included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell .  campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film .  such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard .  also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods .  for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene .  almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became " confused " and were unable to perform the scene .  i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track .  the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all .  don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time .  sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask " have anything to say sam ? "  to me , that's not a good sign .  also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . .  well , compared to rob and bruce anyway .  also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's " gala " premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film .  this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques .  overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre .  and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process .  all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining .  	positive
pos_350	synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure .  everyone else around him has similar symptoms .  lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain .  his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans .  and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living .  the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father .  when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family .  will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ?  opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone .  likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it .  sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world .  the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty .  american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie .  the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum .  the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is .  if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .  	positive
pos_354	i was anxious to see this for a long time .  a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he thinks he is .  he proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that .  scream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , " some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . "  it's very familar , your typical horror film .  so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ?  because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff .  this raises another question : how does it do this ?  simple : the characters .  they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette .  they are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times .  you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed .  she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , " what door am i at ? "  and that gets her killed .  that scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen .  the plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis .  but as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing .  that and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , " the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . "  which is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney's friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter .  the cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive .  also good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( " the fonz " ) as the school principal .  i took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival because she covered her mother's disappearance .  i hate that show , i hate those actors .  they're untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn't .  	positive
pos_357	 " if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . "  starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus  in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy .  in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals .  but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge .  crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version .  hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven .  writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots .  before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years .  in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan .  the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little .  within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways .  the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale .  i say " surprisingly " because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong .  and there are ways in which it does .  the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales .  the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes .  probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable .  but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness .  one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen .  part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind .  this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery .  the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality .  the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant .  the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly .  the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary .  this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter .  for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes .  she adeptly blends them all together .  there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance .  the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level .  a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves .   " don't stray from the path , " rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life .  staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders .  carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path .  those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate .  this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge .  if straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk .  when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential .  and it's certainly more interesting than the disney version .  	positive

"  that's the main thrust of writer-director maggie greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story , which is loosely based on olive dame campbell's foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 , but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice .  ornery , bearded , banjo-picking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque , passionate " songcatcher , " while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague ( e .  katherine kerr ) .  i'm ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris , iris dement , taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteer's wide-eyed prot ? g ? .  rated pg-13 , there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " songcatcher " is an intelligent , extraordinary 8 , transported by the transcendent power of song .  	positive
pos_366	 " when it's cold , molecules aren't moving .  everything is clean . "  these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm .  when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey's life and the lives that surround him .  his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) .  ben's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn't say anything .  meanwhile , ben's 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations .  tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character .  we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul .  he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody's own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you'll return .  the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie .  everything parallels everything else .  the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods .   " when it's cold outside , the molecules aren't moving .  everything is clean . "  everything is clean because nobody will admit what's going on .  even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings .  how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ?  all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that's the point of the film .  at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn't it parallel itself ?  you don't get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that's because nobody in the movie knows each other either .  we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another .  at first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven't gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain .  the acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood .  he doesn't seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being .  christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy .  still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen's subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline .  tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost .  he was needed , but perhaps he should've been used more .  the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year .  i hate to say that i don't agree , but i don't .  in fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one .  even so , it is a very good film .  it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it's art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn't before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story .  perhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes .  	positive
pos_376	i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years .  it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood .  but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex .  yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster .  for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage .  and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking .  and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer .  `american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year .  just how great are their hormones raging ?  one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot .  the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim .  kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right .  but what is the perfect time ?  there is just no way to know , and that frightens him .  oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive .  he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages .  finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl .  so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess .  suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him .  but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful .  when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through .  he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge .  this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny .  the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating .  there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald .  in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating .  but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison .  teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest .  but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here .  these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex .  their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences .  they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility .  but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch .  	positive
pos_380	ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start .  a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ?  with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ?  yuck .  but it's not really too bad .  it has a lot working against it , for me at least .  in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it .  it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable .  just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip .  through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity .  in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love .  the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples .  so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman's model for this film ) .  will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ?  will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ?  will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren't they all ? ) ?  will they finally kiss ?  well , what do you expect ?  but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film .  pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show .  one word of caution , though .  this film is being billed in some places as a " family " movie .  don't let that stop you .  however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move .  after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions .  all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  	positive
pos_384	i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price .  as the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking .  jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e .  the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion .  this stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) .  he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross .  rosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross .  herman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this .  but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love .  the academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) .  it maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub .  the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic .  the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well .  i hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers .  	positive

pos_395	jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance .  for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film .  daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes .  the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) .  he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes .  however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society .  he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) .  arlo is not happy with his job .  he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer .  and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her .  this is the situation when a new case comes knocking .  gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys .  it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence .  now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end .  to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell .  however , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and  this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme .  for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic .  zero effect is weakest in its obviously " wacky " scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior .  such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character .  however , there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out .  that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film .  in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer .  however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own .  once the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine .  his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own .  as the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer .  zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well .  zero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes .  however , we are always kept distant from gloria's character .  she's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking .  perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment .  but , on the whole , it is frustrating .  bill pullman , when he's not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero .  there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well .  and , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called " zero " seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name .  although zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise .  	positive
pos_396	well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise .  not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 .  once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer .  the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns .  it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent .  the plot in brief .  paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons .  his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans .  he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf .  he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires .  but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric .  i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging .  british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) .  but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding .  the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character .  york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic .  this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him .  and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths .  the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original .  the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 .  the film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless .  and it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock .  in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end .  tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation .  but these are minor complaints .  just see it .  not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years .  and michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude .  	positive
pos_397	in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural " rush hour " - to the tune of about $250 million .  you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in " rush hour 2 . "  the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in " rush hour " that played well to audiences around the world .  the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable .  i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations .  surprisingly , " rush hour 2 " wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it .  the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start .  terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime .  concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights .  instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars .  the makers of " rush hour 2 " are working at a distinct advantage over the original .  we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around .  that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit .  little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in " rush hour . "  first and foremost to me , in " rh2 , " is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography .  the 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint .  chan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket .  his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino .  like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch .  chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys .  when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun .  when lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff .  the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills .  the combo of chan's flying feet and fists with tucker's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the " lethal weapon " films .  the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently .  john lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) .  lone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to " get lee and carter , " but gives the chief bad guy elegance .  zhang zi-yi ( " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter .   ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . )  roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is terrific to watch .  director ratner and the original " rush hour " production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera .  cinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives " rh2 " the fluid camera movement the genre film needs .  production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino .  the rest of the techs are of the same high quality .  i'm surprised to even say that " rush hour 2 " is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies .  it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer .  i give it a b .  	positive

pos_401	_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .  if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority !  first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ?  well , yes ? and no .  it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems .  when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? !  i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?  gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?  i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect .  it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice !  i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) ,  so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much .  did i ? yes and no .  mainly yes , i'm happy to say .  the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the " human " aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting .  the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course !   : - ) ) .  well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat .  does it work here ?  in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story .  what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film .  her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her .  also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving .  it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .  in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance .  it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable .  there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending .  which leads us to the second half of the film .  we all knew it was coming .  i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film .  i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die .  the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .  and it is an hour .  my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ?  gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of " entertainment " in other films .  but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .  not that i'd expect the word " understatement " to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as " terminator 2 " and " aliens " ) .  is it overdone ?  i thought so .  understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .  no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half .  still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears !  you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive .  perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface .  the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .  i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .  so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive .  haven't mentioned the script .  plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything .  as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 .  it's a period drama .  but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .  did they really use phrases like " goddamn it ! "  back in the turn of the century ?  i doubt it .  would someone talk like this : " do ya love the guy or what ?

pos_409	the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered .  with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols .  their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness .  less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue .  not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development .  that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level .  the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis .  intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of " human interconnectedness " and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) .  shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene .  those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself .  adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london .  every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives .  he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years .  she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction .  they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation .  as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines .  in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy .  if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment .  chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train .  the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines .  these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes .  separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center .  despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you'd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image .  intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw .  an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) .  as claire's cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk .  bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with .  his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations .  in his unassuming way , spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best .  he's that good .  	positive
pos_410	george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother .  after mr . and mrs . little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j . fox ) .  george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) .  george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat ) .  stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi ) .  the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect .  there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the " supporting cast " are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak ) .  it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with .  stuart little is a charming family film .  there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m . night shyamalan no less ! ) ,  some moments that can only be described as " too cute " ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable .  kids and parents will love this one .  stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video .  there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 .  both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio .  both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) .  there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . .  get it ?  it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . .  i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) .  dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game .  but wait . . .  there's still more !  there's a section called " basement treasures " where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) .  the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson .  they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production .  minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) .  anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur .  the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film .  movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one .  now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now .  one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called " i need to know " by a group called r angels .  this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party .  the girls ask a ouija board " i need to know . . .  who to do , who to do , who to do " as the song begins .  they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits .  then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like " i'll be your pleasure all the time . . .  just say the words that you'll be mine " .  um . . .  what the hell ?  what does this have to do with stuart little ?  how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ?  when the video concludes , the words " to be continued " appear .  oh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out .  kids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a " kid at heart " thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them .  this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost .  the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar .  	positive
pos_411	countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally .  luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation .  otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer .  in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans .  in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times .  those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery .  the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film .  like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since .  perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away .  or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before .  anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life .  and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic .  star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) .  it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema .  until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , " personal " or " artsy " movies .  as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen .  george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue .  the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood .  serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of " blockbuster " philosophy .  one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre .  until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain .  in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey .  but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies .  however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it .  as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s .  after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment .  ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of " new hollywood " generation of young movie authors who made " artsy " and " personal " films in early 1970s .  george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti .  both movies were considered " personal " in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular .  in a sense , star wars is an also very " personal " film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it .  but unlike many " personal " movies of the era , its " personality " was in line with the wishes of the general audience .  the plot , set " a long time ago , in a galaxy far away " , begins in a time of civil war .  the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic .  in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets .  the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser .  princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) .  those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot .  his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) .  old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force .  after some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force .  their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) .  critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of " new hollywood " , are prone to point the lack of originality .  on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress .  on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) .  the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .  even out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art .  george lucas' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup .  characters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster .  we have a " coming-of-age " hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters .  some of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form .  unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career .  the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology .  often comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas' superiority over kubrick .  however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie .  that honour should definitely go to the " oscar " -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career .  newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release .  yet , even if they are immune to the george lucas' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture .  	positive
pos_414	jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation .  even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation .  this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction .  to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn .  he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide .   ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . )  tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm .  nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own .  the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her .  jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas .  this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico .  however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs .  jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted .  of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell .  ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police .  sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she " borrows " max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell .  instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal .  since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars .  with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ?  by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film .  however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think .  jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max .  the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around .  instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies .  at least this film has a little imagination .  most of the performances in jackie brown are above par .  pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable .  samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control .  robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . .  never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course .  he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade .  in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town .  unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences .  in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , " little bit , " and " pretty much . "  fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side .  as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy .  it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves .  don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however .  there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience .  we look at the screen and think , " gee , that's clever , " and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on .  although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film .  there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head .  this is a tribute to both direction and acting .  however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something .  we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop .  overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well .  some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today .  in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these " offensive " words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness .  go see the film and see what i mean .  	positive

( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . )  a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended .  there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite .  but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children .  the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas .  but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise .  music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums .  it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians .  if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .  	positive
pos_417	disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan .  while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults .  fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's  just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time .  while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind .  but there is trouble on the horizon .  the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china .  the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army .  the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate .  mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life . . . by  secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield .  mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d .  wong , singing : donny osmond ) .  but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in  typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized " guardian " dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) .  much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story .  sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it .  the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience .  but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) .  the animation is on par with some of disney's best .  the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring .  the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable .  at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around .  mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date .  most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) .  there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating .  children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies .  it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition .  if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands .  instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .  	positive
pos_419	the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself .  but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things .  not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion .  i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ?  that's basically how i felt about this movie .  i mean , it's not very good , but it's not completely bad either .  the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) .  she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you  know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) .  thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) .  near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods .  once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in ) .  making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars .  one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) .  they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal .  after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to " take care " of the problem .  managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband .  but then one night , cole shows up . . .  and here is where the fun begins .  from this point on , it's going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects .  this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out .  and for the most part , they're right ; the rich man's wife has nary one original bone in it's body .  but who cares ?  if you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie , you can't do much better than this .  and if you suspense buffs aren't already sold , it has a killer of an ending too .  	positive
pos_430	synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians .  meanwhile , the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her .  comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it .  drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey .  mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made .  it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about .  i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel .  the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film .  the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures .  to throw a curveball into the fray , billy's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes .  a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film .  look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper .  definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren't for the squeamish .  	positive
pos_432	based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal .  now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all .  his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he  must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires .  admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some .  judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film .  to some degree , i agree with this sentiment .  having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade .   ( " men in black " is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book )  why is this ?  for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand  the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match .  the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided .  the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect .  superman  is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this .  blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere .  this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show .  batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready ) .  which brings me back to blade .  although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon .  the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that  uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends .  the end results are not pretty by any means .  the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story .  screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films .  this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright .  this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires .  add this  to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an " anti-theft device " ) , and one has an interesting premise .  however , the film works best as an action film .  actor wesley snipes has  an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move .  proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a  good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes .  regardless , this film is far from perfect .  the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god .  the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on  marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) .  obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) .  much of the special effects are not that spectacular either .  while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times ) .  scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i'm really hard to impress ) .  the film's r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of  realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence ,  watch " saving private ryan " ) .  the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi .  still , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade's sword without deactivating the " anti-theft device " .  wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess .  while not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust .  a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps .  	positive
pos_434	the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm !   ( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio )   " unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise .  unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited .  unlike fires , there is no way to combat them .  unlike floods , their terror is sudden . "  - excerpt from twister production notes  i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .  i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister .  the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .  it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . .  basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up !  twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .  these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that  is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !  jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .  while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo .  apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman .  he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone .  jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .  the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function .  to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device .  thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans .  plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about .  twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get .  there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) .  helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself !  thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock !  jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .  like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited .  audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen !  the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !   ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie .  now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent !  watch it in a good theatre . . . please .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  	positive
pos_444	a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite .  they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too .  they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb .  men in black is a four-star three-star film .   ( hope you could follow that one )  men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun .  just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use .  after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ?  men in black is , of course , the organization which " moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth " .  nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes .  the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof .  naturally nobody believes his story .   .   .  nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of .  edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib .  edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) .  james edwards no longer exists .  meet agent jay .  agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about " regular " duties .  eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play .  a " bug " has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it .  the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the " bug " does .  barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely .  it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed .  a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be .  this is one of those movies that is just " fun " and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer .  will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch .  definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me !  	positive
pos_446	 " desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 .  for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january .  now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film .  michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) .  keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape .  he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies .  the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son .  the film definately has it's flaws .  the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status .  also , after keaton's escape , garcia's captain barks at him " how many men have to die to save your kid's life ? "  which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark .  the thing is , it's a vaild point .  how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ?  what's the greater good here ?  many lives or one life ?  if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character .  place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else .  alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable .  despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about " desperate measures " outnumber the bad .  the main highlight would be keaton's performance .  the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely .  he's not as menacing as he was in " pacific heights " or even as menacing as he was in " batman " ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he's evil .  even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film .  so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest .  and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you've seen a billion times before .  and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen .  but it doesn't , and that's creative .

pos_447	what is a scary movie anyhow ?  is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ?  is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ?  possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer .  what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters .  movies like " halloween " and " psycho " which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled " the exorcist " , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 " the exorcist " comes back to the big screen in a version you've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending .  chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan .  while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden .  when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter .  father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl .  christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl .  excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death .  now we get to the experience " the exorcist " the way it was meant to be seen in a director's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more .  the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing .  the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness .  as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is " the exorcist " nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on .  ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in " requiem for a dream " to which she is getting rave reviews for .  jason miller ( jason patrik's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along .  i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff !  anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going .  hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .  	positive
pos_452	if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october .  you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator .  in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them .  the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel .  set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october .  the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection .  the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery .  ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas .  he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean .  is he planning to start world war iii ?  cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub .  the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid .  baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor .  sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer .  it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , " ace of spies . "  the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser .  the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot .  screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns .  they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment .  the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action .  the finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler .  	positive
pos_453	i was pleasantly surprised by this film .  with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see .  how much could you dress up the sets ?  how many models and computer effects could you use ?  how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ?  oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school .  after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie .  there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen .  titanic tells its story in two time periods .  it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship .  what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news .  the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas .  there she tells her story to lovett and his team .  in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york .  she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word .  on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( " steerage " , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping .  although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal .  the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .  dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors .  his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations .  girls are going to swoon over him .  winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable .  the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing .  simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante .  rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting .  billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him .  his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate .  he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model .  like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well .  backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or " man " as they said at the turn of the century ) .  no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match .  additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as " the unsinkable " molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie .  nice to see dr . bombay getting work .  also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .  this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else .  in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures .  you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well .  as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects .  the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic .  with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .  cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet .  could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless .  also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .  we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner .  these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion .  in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .  the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending .  in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .  	positive
pos_455	pollock starring ed harris , marcia gay harden , tom bower , jennifer connelly screenplay by barbara turner and susan j . emshwiller , based on the book " jackson pollock : an american saga " by steven naifeh and gregory white smith directed by ed harris   * * * for more film , dvd and books about movie reviews , plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival , visit _film freak central_ - http : //filmfreakcentral . net  | now with search engine * * *   " how do you know when you're finished making love ? "  -jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting  jackson pollock's " making love " quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , " it's like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means . "  it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept .  the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art .  arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema .   ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . )  granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable " purpose " of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing .  the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions .  and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion .  _pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression .  a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush .  in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , " you paint the fucking thing , " and leaves in a huff .  by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision .   ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . )  such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does .  while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : " you are killing me !  you are killing me !  you are killing me ! "   ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . )  pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth .  i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well .  it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images .  one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break .  a more seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal .  	positive
pos_459	the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i've seen in years .  but then again , i've always had this phobia of asian born horror films .  i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced , long-haired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh .  the ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended .  unlike the horror films coming from the west , i'm pretty much used to the gore and visual effects , so much so , they become rather bland nowadays .  there's really no scary movie from the west for a long time .  if you have something in mind , please tell me .  this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by `the stephen king of japan' , which is also ( i heard ) televised over the air in japan .  the film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it , one week prior to viewing .  a journalist and her husband , stupid enough , tests the so call `urban legend' and ends up having a week before she meets her doom .  she and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette , to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves .  the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today .  visual subtlety , minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film .  very well done indeed , especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore .  now , thats something budding horror film-maker wannabes should consider looking into .  just an idea of how visually powerful the film is , it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese ; both of which , i can't understand at all ( ok , i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching , but he revealed very little ! ) .  the twists in the plot , leading to an unforgettable climax ( will definitely leave an impression on the audience ) will have you at the edge of your seat .  	positive
pos_461	vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks .  it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about .  based on anne rice's novel , " interview with a vampire " is a long , dark trip to hell .  the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco .  the camera slowly find particular window .  a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness .   " so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? " .  the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater ) .  his tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise ) .  given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret .  everlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace .  louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough .  eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis .  for a while , they are one " big , happy family . "  but all things end , and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation .  when luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned .  director neil jordan ( " the crying game " ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere .  as the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun .  when luis is " born to darkness " , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight .  the beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film .  from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days .  the casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain .  the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective .  cruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty .  cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance .  with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear .   " . . . kill them mercifully , but do it .  you are what you are . . for  do not doubt , you are a killer ! "  that is how lestat is teaching luis .  but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages .  brad pitt is equally convincing as the " vampire with a human soul " .  antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible .  the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character .  the world is changing around the little child , but she does not .  she remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity .  only her wise , dark eyes reveal her age .  ironically the film's only miss is the script .  anne rice's novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera :  claudia : " . . . . is that what i should do ?  let you go . . my  father , my luis , who made me . . . who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? "  luis : " everything will be alright . . "  claudia : " do you really believe that ? "  and then they hug emotionally .  moments like those displayed above and luis' self-pity is a bit tiresome .  however rice's script is otherwise strong and well structured , bringing up humor and comic episodes , that were more or less hidden in the book .  when lestat finds claudia's dead dressmaker , whom she has killed , he cries out : " who will make you that dress now ?  be a little practical . . . . never  in the house ! "  moments like that are both entertaining and appealing .  neil jordan's direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity , homosexuality , love and loneliness .  his gothic saga is not meant to scare , but to display these issues differently .  wrapped up in mystery , his new , original picture brings vampire-films to a new height .  	positive
pos_470	 " love is the devil " is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline .  watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter .  everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally .  but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on .  exactly what was i looking at ?  watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous .  directed ( and written ) by john maybury , " love is the devil " is stylish masterpiece for the senses .  everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing .  the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close .  the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche .  as such , there is no real story .  i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like .  he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty .  as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero .  he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him .  it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( " champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , " he says one night at the bar he frequents ) .   " love is the devil " chronicles the latter part of his life .  bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor .  he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) .  bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning .  george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason .  the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another .  while creating bacon's world of friends ( like " high art , " this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant .  bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings .  while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there .  the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about .  once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together .  i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was .  someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in .  thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother .  i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's " battleship potemkin " ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain .  he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george .  i guess that explains the title .  a bit .  that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning .  i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) .  or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche .  it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat .  that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not .  i can't say i totally enjoyed " love is the devil , " though .  despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through .  even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour .  though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it .  as such , i respect the way the film looks .  it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with " what dreams may come " and " dark city , " it's the year's most visually stunning film .  in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever .  and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs .  i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance .  then i would have had something to hold me over even now .  	positive
pos_472	jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled " kevin smith's greatest hits " for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith's earlier works including , clerks , mall rats .  chasing amy and dogma .  so , be advised : bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith's latest outing .  kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature , most notably miramax , the studio whose subsidiary , dimension films , is jay and silent bob's distributor .  others deserving accolades include ben affleck , matt damon , directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas .  this is a laugh-filled , foul-mouthed road film with jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( smith ) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax's production of bluntman and chronic , comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers .  jay's convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down , people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob , even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing , but rather their comic book counterparts .  no matter , the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country .  but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker , played by george carlin , who tells them to follow " the book " - the rules of the road .  of course jay's interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun ( carrie fisher ) who offers them a ride .  jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie's weaker aspects - which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell - can be easily tolerated .  really , how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van , and jay has a pot-induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne .  the movie's highlight , though , is near the finale .  in hollywood , jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck-damon picture , good will hunting 2 : hunting season .  here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other's careers and film choices .  and the laughs continue to grow .  next up is jason ( american pie ) biggs and james ( dawson's creek ) van der beek , the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic .  the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles .  finally , comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature .  this bit will leave you howling .  smith's obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers .  he allows them to play it all tongue-in-cheek .  their fun comes through the screen to the audience .  it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob's swan song .  the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks .  but smith realizes that times have changed , and he doesn't want his creations to overstay their welcome .  so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit , saving the best for last .  goodbye jay and silent bob .  at least you're going out with a blast .  	positive

pos_474	let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing .  but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie .  the new " m " is a woman ) .   " tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " .  the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine .  as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media .  carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from " dr .  strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) .  it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women .  enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero .  they make a great team .   " tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " .  spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " .  moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language .  returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit .  and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain .  in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures .  there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue .  and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here .  as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed .  now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . .  it's time to put them to use in something truly special .  there's no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies .  -reviewed december 17 , 1997  	positive

what a cast .  ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic .  one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church .  ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) .  now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels .  salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way .  azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win .  bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith .  what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie .  who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself .  now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart .  yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god .  this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie .  kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie .  of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob .  probably the best characters in movies that i like .  the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while .  the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think .  chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines .  linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is .  of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) .  alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles .  being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could .  ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story .  the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it .  however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' .  while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it .  'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you .  all kevin smith fans must see ! !  	positive
pos_477	if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild .  yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen .  mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties .  ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo )  spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times .  fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms . austen originally penned in her novel . )  writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes .  from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal .  what ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny .  the result is a central character that is immediately appealing .  as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work .  at times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations .  this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does .  the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one . . .  whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ?  fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well .  his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny .  while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending .  other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park . . .  the slave trade .  there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten .  the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust .  fanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy .  fanny's own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she " married for love . "  fanny , given those two terrible examples , and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean .  the spiritual answer , of course , lies in the middle of those two extremes .  marriage is not a cold , calculating decision based upon self-preservation .  neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace .  in the purest sense , marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one .   " and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? "  matthew 19 : 5 [kjv]  love and logic can be combined .  god's word contains both .  so does a marriage based upon his truth .  	positive
pos_482	sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to .  it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy .  yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story .  the wings of the dove fits the pattern .  kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love .  merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate .  but kate's " job " , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class .  her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man .  naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as " rich . "  kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable .  kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice .  at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees .  kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her .  it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup .  merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it .  he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute .  the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated .  let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton .  merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate .  kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple .  a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact .  at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies .  millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate .  she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees .  kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together .  merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her .  he's not sure he can separate the two .  kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else .  the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved .  without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly .  the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament .  one is left with feelings of regret and despair .  what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy .  an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir .  a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after .  their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake .  i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting .  as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot .  roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie .  millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible .  i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion .  their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially .  still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over .  	positive
pos_483	earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics .  a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience .  now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter .  there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing .  the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland .  ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed .  enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village .  the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud .  ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael .  jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man .  the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience .  every viewer is sure to like both of them .  there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer .  this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary .  overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously .  the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout .  the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff .  in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial .  it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes .  there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one .  indeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss .  	positive
pos_488	it has happened again .  a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed .  it is involving , suspenseful . . .  it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus .  but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie .  the sixth sense is that movie .  starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle .  eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people .  not just in dreams .  and not just as lifeless bodies .  he sees them walking around like regular people .  and he sees them all the time .  dr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him .  he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself .  if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest .  but first he needs to gain cole's trust .  the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . .  not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . .  about his " secrets . "  crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy .  bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development .  crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees .  mr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona .  eleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance .  he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro .  it is fine work for one of such a tender age .  keep your eye on this young man .  the supporting cast is also quite effective .  toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe's ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable .  twenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it .  it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended .  in giving the sixth sense a favorable " three star " review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading .  there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the " living dead . "  the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself .  the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , " thou shall not surely die , " a direct contradiction of god's admonition .  that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages .  scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . .  an event which has not yet occurred .  therefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound .  and then , you'll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens .  	positive
pos_489	in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon .  in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it .  gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll .  mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt .  so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors .  but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy .  to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat .  his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back .  payback is often a very violent film .  to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films .  the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot .  when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot .  so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end .  it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities .  in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities .  but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him .  my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive .  gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job .  he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance .  this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) .  the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) .  if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role .  in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work .  	positive
pos_490	the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of " leila , " a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features .  although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers .  set in modern-day iran , " leila " begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) .  as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet .  earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child .  when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children .  nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) .  bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with .  leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing .  there are no easy answers to be found within " leila , " a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration .  almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman .  maybe because " leila " is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence .  leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances .  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply .  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible .  although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another .  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her .  these " small " moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman .  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer .  refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below .  despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him .  sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?  in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair .  unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words .  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else .  for all of its strong aspects , " leila " isn't a perfect film .  on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .  and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before .  mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi .  despite these minor missteps , " leila " is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la .  the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return .  it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .  	positive

" lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of " fargo " and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me .  i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain .  the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter .  john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards .  russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema .  she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market .  crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager .  she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town .  much like " fargo , " this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick .  he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery .  along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , " dale the thug " ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process .  there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down .  i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting .  this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should .  where as " fargo " was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , " lucky numbers " is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously .  it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that .  travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep .  he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill .  crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself .  kudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on " friends . "  here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe .  i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .  like " jackie brown , " ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally .  the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .  more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do .  the ending itself is great .  it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good .  you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) .  i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?  	positive
neg_3	 " quest for camelot " is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried .  the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , " but disney's " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation .  this year , it's no contest , as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival .  even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this .  the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table .  kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest .  with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side .   " quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney .  there's nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage .   ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra .  i rest my case . )  even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others .  in the end , it's a tie -- they all win .  that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse .  at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage .  a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) .  but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good .  aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , " quest for camelot " 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality .  and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .  	negative
neg_5	capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace .  there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise .  john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) .  john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes .  for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make .  ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace .  in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue .  this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness .  it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way .  but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience .  ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 .  mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) .  it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film .  society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little .  apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control .  and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things .  society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten .  the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony .  instead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson , this film has the criminal " desolation " williams .  instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars .  because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination .  the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback .  ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black .  carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat .  sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup .  the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss .  his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring .  these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience .  somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights .  within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars .  after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by .  i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  following the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter's classic assault on precinct 13 .  her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice .  	negative
neg_6	so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about .  is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ?  is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ?  or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?  i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera .  i'm talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher .  with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence .  is " 8mm " something you really want to see ?  probably not .  the first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core .  then , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence .  and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further .  trust me .  there are better ways to waste two hours of your life .  nicolas ' " snake eyes " ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder .  welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this .  welles certainly makes it look easy .  and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues .  the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader's " hardcore . "  occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task .  there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa .   " 8mm " doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it .  the irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product .  so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror .  later it's the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who's quite good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again .  all this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me .  neither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality .  	negative
neg_10	best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on .  usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do .  if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda .  cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge .  big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad .  what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light .  he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . )  he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world .  l . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia .  filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) .  in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e .  highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 .  he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do .  this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . )  l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven .  there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger .  rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length .  concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted .  cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster .  dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent .  we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene .  the restraint is admirable .  but l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material .  when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious .  director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations .  it's too much .  there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie .  this plot thread predictably leads to violence .  not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note .  it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note .  in this regard , l . i . e .   ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed .  how often does real life work this way ?  to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ?  	negative
neg_17	so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ?  well , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here .  this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !  it's like i said . . . this  movie sucks .  plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet .  critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie .  uneven , would be another .  the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go " somewhere " .  but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the " pain " of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix .  in a sci-fi movie ?  well , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement .  ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their " misadventures in space " for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact .  mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well .  of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story .  ugh .  what a friggin' mess .  films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again .  didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ?  didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! ) .  of course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians .  'nuff said .  neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my  ears hurt ! ) .  so is anything salvageable in this movie ?  sure .  gary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the " sand-twister " effect that you see in the commercial is well done .  other than that ?  i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops ,  did i say " admire " , i meant " am disgusted " !  all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck .  go see the ninth gate . . . now  there's a great movie !  and on a personal note , i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting .  	negative
neg_23	 " snake eyes " is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing .  it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare .  and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents .  it's worse than that .  it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness .  or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness .  in certain circles , " snake eyes " was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic " rashomon , " where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb .  in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens .  there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out .  this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction .  what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and  discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy .  as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened .  this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then  it takes one wrong step .  we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out .  but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it .  it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting .  it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible .  events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina .  that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay .  this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena .  what went wrong ?  depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this .  depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , " blow out , " where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece .  but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries .  at least his direction makes up partly for it .  then there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier " carlito's way , " a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well .  he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort .  he's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic .  a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup .  he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like .  this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way .  as i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe .  now there's a film .  unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma .  	negative
neg_25	one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .  after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave .  he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing .  however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year .  the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation .  these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly .  it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it's only when things are over that they make sense . "  whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided .  the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone .  instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last .  only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it .  but don't fret , it will surface again .  you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile .  but you hold hope for some time .  the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations .  it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope .  and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ?  to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene .  the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .  watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him .  and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities .  the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them .  unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .  sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words .  the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .  you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners .  the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .  steven spielberg is picked on in particular .  while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .  it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .  the days of breathless are no more .  	negative
neg_29	one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible .  orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events .  the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do .  for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth .  we're still here .  the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse .  we're still here .  some of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) .  also , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like .  if it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's going to be incredibly boring .  the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video .  it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed .  also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods .  audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this .  i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me .  certainly i never expected a remastered print .  curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case .  but they're menu screens . . .  so who really cares ?

neg_30	play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .  like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .  shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .  shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .  play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .  the film has no social message like its predecessors .  the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .  the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .  unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .  1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .  the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .  2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .  there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .  3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .  she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .  4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .  vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .  these boring tales only hurt the central plot .  5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other .  wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?  by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .  shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .  forty five painful minutes remain .  the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .  however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .  	negative
neg_31	some movies i should just skip .  my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .  true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon .  but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen .  but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ?  turns out i was right , mostly .  inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick .  at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .  this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn't just business , it's a way of life .  the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .  in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany !  i want more zany here -- and -- here . "   " let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful .  i want the audience squirming in their seats . "   " ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "   " what does this scene do ?  character depth ?  but where's the zaniness ?  i don't see zany here .  if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "  the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie .  michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time .  my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor .  dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby .  i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes .  he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor .  oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town .  or , maybe all career politicians are like that .  i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla .  he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget .  rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw .  joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself .  her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film .  d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years .  the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad .  the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context .  a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib .  about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw .  gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget .  penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon .  let me rage here just for a minute .  michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character .  she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective .  why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery .  the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity .  inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment .  probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits .  the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen .  all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films .  i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers .  but if true , why ?  if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .  	negative
neg_33	i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film .  i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach .  throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof !  we'll have a hit on our hands ! "  the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography .  the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels .  keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption .  gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers .  rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders .  this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's .  the usual things happen like clockwork .  the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax .  it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks .  howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes .  obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end .  sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life .  the replacements offers none of this .  	negative
neg_34	if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then " bully " 's for you .  based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood .  the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers .  in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities .  in terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new .  the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane .  the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department .  he hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby .  simply remove him from the equation .  marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off .  there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment .  they did it because they wanted to , and because they could .  what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material .  not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully " but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it .  gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there's something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) .  clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about .  the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera .  the conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime .  it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it .

neg_37	 " lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics " that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . "   " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -it's directed by the same guy who did " house " -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda . "  paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake .  discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) .  they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them .  along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake .  you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while " jaws " -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist .  unlike its slippery cousin " anaconda , " " lake placid " wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating .  the result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious .  while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of " friday the 13th " and " halloween h20 " ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like " ally mcbeal " and " chicago hope " ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick .  the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it .   ( " lake placid " manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself ) .  the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course .  like the snake in " anaconda , " the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural .   " lake placid " also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine .  there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how " we really don't know much about crocodiles . "  they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers .  a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ?  creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on .  pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot .  most of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers .  platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script .  	negative
neg_42	a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists .  in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character .  living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other .  this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant .  24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . "  although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) .  for her to do photos for " frame , " lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her .  lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson .  the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin .  this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture .  syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club .  lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother .  lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being " pigeonholed , " and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses .  a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical .  that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny .   " your work has a cultural currency that is important now , " is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine .  when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , " i want to get high with you . "  in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand .  and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene .  this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions .  in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted .  high art runs 1 : 36 .  it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age .  	negative

"  starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii .  rated r .  the legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast .  it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . .  1900 .  you heard right .  his name is , in all actuality , 1900 .  he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman .  1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that he might be taken away from him because of " visa matters . "  well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship .  one day , he discovers a grand piano .  he sits down and starts playing .  miraculously , what comes out is beautiful .  a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age .  when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is " totally against regulations " 1900 replies " f * ck the regulations ! "  ho ho ho .  1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land .  when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician .  his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet .  after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it .  how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask .  after that , 1900 and max become friends .  max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so .  what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp !  -- they're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record .  the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store .  the record shouldn't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken .  ladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery !  the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .  we're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . .  piano duel ?  there isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel .  1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life .  ditto for max , who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 .  tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there's no spirit , no gusto to the character .  he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead .  pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit .  the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering " king of jazz " who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel .  the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many .  this effort is utterly limp and lifeless .  at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .  	negative
neg_50	my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free .  as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book .   ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " )  languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending .  since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery .  other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture .  with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host .  he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant .  one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project .  surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there .  perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success .  or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone .  the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day .  this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .  sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) .  after throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car .

( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . )  after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie .  we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die .  to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers .  let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie .  my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it .  matthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been .

neg_51	talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters !  spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls .  it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch .  when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name .  the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented .  there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat .  the film itself doesn't really have a plot .  it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall .  the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas .  the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even  when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff .  whew .  for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos .  from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf .  heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld .  richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford .  the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film .  neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring .  their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos .  my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either  option will be more enjoyable than the film .  non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .  	negative
neg_55	funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways .  the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature .  what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters .   " get new jobs ! "  was one line , if i remember correctly .  at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda .  he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off .  patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) .  the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy .  they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature .  give me a break .  the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us .  even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic .  get this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up .  he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird .  by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand .  the acting is forgettable .  douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it's nothing he hasn't done before .  kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography .  the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent .  what did i expect from this movie ?  i dunno .  some real excitement , i suppose .  a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation .  no such luck .  i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway's " the short happy life of francis macomber " and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind .  	negative
neg_58	of course i knew this going in .  why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were " attracted to the characters .  they were really original . "  original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon .  her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .  what does she do ?  she invents a fiance !  then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female .  he , of course , goes along with it .  gee , i wonder if they get together in the end .  i've seen more original stuff on the wb .  and better stuff too .  picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .  	negative
neg_59	louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice .  in order to woo his lady love serina , louie makes friends with a young boy , sammy , who persuades teacher mrs . hammerbottom ( carol burnett ) to allow louie to attend class .  louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock , but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina .  to make matters worse , louie's father feels he's lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e . b .  white's " trumpet of the swan . "  as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so , e . b .  white is being returned to for children's films .  the animated " charlotte's web " has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of " stuart little . "   " trumpet of the swan , " directed by richard rich ( 1999's animated " the king and i , " the " swan princess " series ) , is unlikely to be remembered along with those two .   " trumpet of the swan " is receiving a regional theatrical release , but is sure to quickly appear on home video .  boston is one of the targetted cities because our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown .  he encounters a gypsy-like con man in the public gardens who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to boston's swan boats .  louie stays at the ritz carlton before giving a concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river .  at this point , louie's earned enough money so that dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serina's father .   " trumpet of the swan " features flat background art , some poor sound syncing and insipid , sugary songs .  this effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen , but may be ok for the real small set .  	negative
neg_60	one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles .  he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star .  after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film .  unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for .  we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do .  then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is .  the plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas .  dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went .  and he found out again and again and again . "  of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell .  a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians .  but the film talks down to the viewer .  dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country .  he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios .  fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service .  then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy .  in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others .  the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be .  fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general .  the results are little different than one would expect .  dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive .  even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains .  but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was .  sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians .  the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences .  federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .  damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter .  mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .  	negative
neg_65	movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .  we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .  this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) .  the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .  so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .  in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .  and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .  this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? )  far too annoying far too often .  like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character .  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .   " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement .  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things !  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he'd be . . . well ,  he'd be a good screenwriter .  instead , this project may have sunk his career .  he wrote the ( ha ha ! )  script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .  the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones .  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .  after the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " .  nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away .  first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .  she sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .  hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . . .  maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .  crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .  he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show .  crystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal's understudy .  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's " not a whore " .  that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous .  of course she is !  she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that .  we're supposed to root for her .  no way !  she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax .  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .  the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .  it sure ain't character development !  plummer also appeared in " speed " in '94 in a smaller , yet better role .  this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control .  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " .  that picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s .  now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too .  his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don't learn anything about him .  he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .  is he a villain ?  who cares !  ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit .  everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .  what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is .  everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .  it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .  if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?  it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage .  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body .  after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .  oops , they're bad actors , too .  well , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone .  useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen .  	negative
neg_75	it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable .  the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed .  it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner .  what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 .  what drags braveheart down is its screenplay .  it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names .  but this does not save a misguided script .  the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his " heroism " is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him .  but wallace's actions paint a different story .  he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance .  though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king .  wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance .  after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england .  this is evident of a " spartacus complex " , and this example applies both historically and cinematically .  the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay .  it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film .  horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help .  gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him .  this drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time .  	negative
neg_77	ahh yes .  the teenage romance .  an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl .  and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity .  along now comes `down to you' .  the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all .  only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above .  it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to .  this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing .  in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) .  they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies .  from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story .  the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . .  well , only happen in the movies .  fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal .  freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around .  zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue .  rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) .  even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' .  maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd .  as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely .  perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny .  the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired .  the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience .  even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course .  the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) .  when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired .  in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity .  `10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing .  no such luck with `down to you' .  it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end .  and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . .  only in the movies' .  	negative
neg_78	 " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it .  strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner .  prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's " leviathan , " 1989's " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures .   " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on .  based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon .  after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen .  once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted .  after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself .  one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out .  if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct .  although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head .  the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film .  the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play .  in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it .  although 1998's " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here .  donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous .  the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do .  basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one .  it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ?  as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .  	negative

neg_85	it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends .  still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown .  she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club .  everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand .  in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway .  to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean .  however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends .  julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal .  needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island .  accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie .  but was this contest too good to be true ?  the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects .  meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin .  this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island .  eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms .  as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook .  julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar and the words scroll " i still know . . .

neg_88	the first film produced by adam sandler's happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself .  however the difference here is that this one joke just isn't very funny .  rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a " man-whore " to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client's custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home .  deuce goes on numerous " dates " , and each woman he goes out with has a " humorous " quirk about herself .  one has narcolepsy , one has tourette's syndrome , one is a man . . .  etc . etc .  my problem is that we see all of these women in the film's trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ?  seen the trailer . . .  seen the film .  only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles .  deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) .  the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons .  yep , you read that right . . .  there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd .  two scenes are storyboarded . . .  neither of which are particularly exciting .  there are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ?  i wonder what's funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ?  deleted scenes ?  sure .  audio commentary ?  you betcha .  but storyboards ?  come on .

neg_89	tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie .  the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster .  enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious .  the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium .  tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences .  it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look !  art ! " ) ,  although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters .  because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas .  they're not real , sympathetic , or believable .  i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success .  tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) .  one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself .  while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision .  meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host .  with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else .  however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers .  the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious .  tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point .  there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) .  the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious .  for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .  	negative
neg_95	gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement .  as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true .  gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . "  tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green's primal scream .  so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ?  it's clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) .  while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else .  the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' ( green's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times .  green's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy .  but what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ?  a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs .  younger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn't make sense .  by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end , the overall effect is numbness .  while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem , it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy .  rip torn , what were you thinking ?  	negative
neg_105	based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) .  can you say . . . the  third times not a charm ?  plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week .  critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture .  when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign .  i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes .  when you consider that the other " part " of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign .  and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this " big " summer blockbuster .  it blows .  or as they say in french , " eet blows " .  could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ?  maybe .  could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ?  perhaps .  or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ?  naaaaaaah !  a bad movie is a bad movie .  on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in .  branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped .  smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others .  i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie .  then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh  yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked .  little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) .  he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career .  kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 .  they have two kids together , greta simone and owen .  one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has " kasdan " written on it .  lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss .  salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english .  she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas .  since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films .  she stands 5'2 " , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother .  one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) .  another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle .  	negative
neg_106	in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa .  the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government .  after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest .  when the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone .  many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that .  that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt .  however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement .  after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight .  until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon .  unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script .  sometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn't be .  on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl .  on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible .  however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time .  	negative
neg_107	 * * * the following review contains spoilers * * *   " it's just . . .  the way . . .  we are . "  --- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl .  i'll admit it . . .  i love superman iii .  i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise .  supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii .  supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time .  as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in " inner space " , go about their daily lives .  ok . . .  what ?  so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ?  were they living there before krypton exploded ?  how do you get to " inner space " ?  this whole " inner space " notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world .  how do they know where superman went ?  how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ?  these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me .  argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron .  one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art .  kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of " whatever " that protects the city .  in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . .  in three days time , or something .  kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world .  the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) .  selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination .  selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) .  supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives .  ok . . .  huh ?  why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ?  attention movie : explain yourself !  i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much .  i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to .  knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically " wills " herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school .  she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ?  lois lane's sister , lucy .  ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now .  what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . .  complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) .  best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks .  at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense .  there is some credit to give to the film however .  one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an " evil " bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its " prey " is very well done .  also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools .  hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some " menacing " bumper cars ) .  then there were numerous little things that bothered me .  the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . .  it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires .  instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be " graceful " , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers .  also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ?  a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a " wacky " demise .  there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) .  finally , just one word : monsters .  faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line " seize them ! "  at one point ) .  dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies .  helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable .  believability aside though , it's still annoying .  now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd !  they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . .  yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) .  the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters .  the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory .  extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and " special project consultant " scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries .  the transfer on this international version is incredible . . .  you'd think you were watching a new release .  images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts .  only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) .  the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) .  the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .  bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track .  bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation .  although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response .  we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the " almost " appearance in the film by christopher reeve .  great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out .  as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission .  for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one .  szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy " whimsical fantasy " nonsense .  bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office .  again , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one .  anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set .  disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release .  disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long .  the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) .  the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care .  one question though . . .  shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ?  i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd .  i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it .  so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect .  i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc .  as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong .  come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . .  so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started .  at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city .  ugh , i give up .  i'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs .  supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

neg_109	nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- " frankenweenie , " " beetlejuice , " " batman , " " edward scissorhands , " " ed wood , " " mars attacks ! "  -- yet none of them have been horror films .   " sleepy hollow " is his first attempt to actually scare people .  i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this .  i left disappointed .  andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story " the legend of sleepy hollow . "  in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors .  ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders .  several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman .  although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning .  he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret .  along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) .  my reaction : ho-hum .  the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting .  that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages .  however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy .  it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal .  along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series .  a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman .   .   .  well , he's a guy without a head .   .   .  on a horse ( boo ! ) .  the performances are also awful .  although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent .  ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character .  the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish .  the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken .  i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only " bram stoker's dracula " and " mary shelley's frankenstein . "  coppola is an executive producer for " sleepy hollow , " and the script reflects his interest in early forms of " moving pictures , " particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion .   ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other .  when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . )  bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy .  	negative
neg_120	starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see .  therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas .  despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters .  a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the " savages " that live there .  the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust .  only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash .  the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments .  the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth .  governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses .  captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while " slightly " misguided , is good at heart .  pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time .  she even comes complete with insignificant best friend .  again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is .  this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work .  the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation .  maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes .  the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch .  the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , " colors of the wind . "  mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more .  the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character .  i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time .  even the children in the audience seemed restless .  while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed .  perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history .  it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled .  even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious .  as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film .  for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude .  if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this .  or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ?  i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway .  as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression .  in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set .  while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels .  	negative

" switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching .  we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while .  he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit .  lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man .  in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado .  along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) .  this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself .  or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about .  in a sense , that's half of the basic problem with " switchback . "  for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction .  but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense .  some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves .  what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ?  and dennis quaid ?   ( that monotone -- stop it ! )  ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true .  >from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty .  but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals .  the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor .  still , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold .  	negative
neg_132	 " showgirls " is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating .  and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence .  but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking .   " showgirls " is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter .  director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's " basic instinct , " follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer .  it's a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out .  there's the demanding producer .  the loyal friend .  the bitchy competitor .  lest i forget the scummy club owner .  of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity .  unfortunately , " showgirls " doesn't satisfy in this department .  verhoeven's slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic .  to make matters worse , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history .  verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel .  you'll be the wiser for it .  	negative
neg_133	here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie .  now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is .  all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude .  van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives .  van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france .  the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death .  once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are .  jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie .  in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal .  on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked .  sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie .  she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species .  this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents .  nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie .  simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie .  it has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins .  he still can't act .  we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) .  this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par .  	negative
neg_135	 ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair .  elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth .  tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth .  also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother .  while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one .  the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all .  only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters .  and because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not .  the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements .  mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame .  the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good .  she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist .  robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money .  elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e .  flipper , 1996 ) .  his role is also vastly underwritten .  morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role .  like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money .  the supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression .  ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ?  well , yes and no .  although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects .  sadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all .  surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister .  in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity .  what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects .  the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect .  once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie .  let's hope armageddon is a bit better .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  	negative
neg_136	seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats]  the big-budget , mega-hype " event " movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one .  gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis .   " lost in space " is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre .  it's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for .  audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has " star wars " written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects .  battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens .  in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking .  we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources .  each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people .  professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) .  of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are " resolved " at the right moments .  the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable .  the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) .  we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent .  in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent .  yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk .  they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) .  it's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens .  eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not .  the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage .  what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts .  the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as " alien " -lite .  the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive .  but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly .  plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario .  the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring .  by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building .  the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) .   " lost in space " is major film production at its worst .  it's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment .  	negative
neg_139	if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep .  if it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week .  if it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs .  if it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez .   ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip .  for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup .  this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . )  snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater .  snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ?  if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ?  is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ?  will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ?  and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ?  the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer .  if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate .  the trailer is a work of sheer genius .  it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot .  the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross .   ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? )  but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie .  the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match .  unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot .  the trailer gives away much , too much of the story .  the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy .  the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is .  without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level .  as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit .  de palma is maddeningly inconsistent .  he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) .  on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) .  snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value .  the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor .  there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done .  this is what's called giving the devil his due .  but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie .  placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years .  snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent .  cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better .  the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind .  however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .  	negative
neg_140	the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note .  that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much .  cut batgirl out .  cut one of the villains .  it's too much to handle in one dosage .  it's so much that characters get left behind .  poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form .  and elle deserves better .  this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher .  it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) .  the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) .  this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck .  it's up to joel to make it fun though .   " batman forever " was fun .  this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters .  i mean , this one bit .  i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days .  he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?  joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body .  batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart .  meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .  she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .  she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo .  meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl .  meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing .  end of her for all we know .  mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) .  the trio must team together " as family " to beat them .  there ya go .  not the whole story but no big context clues .  too much , right ?  right !  the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels .  however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one .  he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it .  maybe some stunts .  for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy !  and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say .  i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode .  george is in between them .  he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good .  but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) .  the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher .  last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey .  this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze .  we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?  arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points .  when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber .  wow .  but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness .  it's like she's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points .  she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better .  as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . "  alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film .  she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird .  and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time .  but in all fairness , she has virtually no part .  joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although  i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . .  and poor elle .  poor , poor elle .  i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) .  but she has no part ! ! !  it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product .  there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) .  now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there's a couch scene .  in the original , it was with vicki .  in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena .  and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole .  this one , it's nothing .  and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly " part of the family . "  fortunately , we get a lot of alfred .  he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life .  he's a god .  he's a father figure .  he's also dying .  this got to me .  i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me .  we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but  this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered .  but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma .  for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do .  and there are some nice touches .  when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume .  i laughed .  and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . "  i laughed at all these .  the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or  did it just feel like that ?  the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays .  people are fed up with stupid films .  that's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! "  that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever .  that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it .  that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on .  i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste .  i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck .  he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great .  but his costuming for woody allen's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) .  i love the " batman " series .  the first two rocked and i did like the last one .  but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three .  hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time .  and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman .  and michael keaton .  but we can only hope .  	negative
neg_144	dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it .  although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one " dead bore . "  in the film , johnson plays . . .  you guessed it . . .  a cop .  the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on " miami vice . "  a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life .  beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children .  she will not even allow him to wish them " merry christmas " by telephone .  but beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang .  beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop .  his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp .  virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective .  the plot is incoherent and full of holes .  the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions .  the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense .  i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii .  in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction .  dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting .  according to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck .  you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable .  most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above .  william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods .  forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable .  dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( " wkrp in cincinnati " and " frank's place " ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains .  the sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less .  i guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's definitely a dead bang .  the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful script .  johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life .  and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments .  the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him .  but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble .  the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen .  but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make .  	negative
neg_146	 " some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . "  nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel .  the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . "  fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) .  marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history .  he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants .  taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead .  for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings .  her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch .  as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her .  unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer .  theo's assessment of the house ?   " i love it !  sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "  who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ?   ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? )  both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland .  as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused .  later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) .  why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ?  the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti .  his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still .  i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house .  eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically .  thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill .  his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners .  i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .  	negative
neg_149	when i originally saw the trailer for " analyze this " a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame .  and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad .  but then when " analyze this " finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened .  it got great reviews .  critics were proclaiming it " hilarious " and a " dead-on parody of mob movies " .  well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater .  you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ?  well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for .   " analyze this " is slow , unfunny , and badly acted .  don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here .  i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material .  he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama .  if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the " naked gun " series , he probably would have been a lot more successful .  as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others .  this doesn't work .  it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him .  and the movie is badly paced , too .  it never takes off .  it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum .  i think the blame for this should be placed on the script .  it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere .  the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues .  this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie .  i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny .  if " analyze this " had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me .  i would have been too busy laughing to notice .  but as it is , i only chuckled a few times .  the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of " the godfather " .  sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing .  but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population .  i loathed " there's something about mary " , yet loved " baseketball " .  now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see " office space " .  it's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as " analyze this " did .  	negative
neg_152	there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened .  and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why .  this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago .  fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky .  it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) .  it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit .  seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa .  no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa .  it's the environmental protection agency .  i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice .  written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks .  but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in .  seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket .  but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free .  that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches .  slow and plodding , this project is a total mess .  the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige .  here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness .  townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued .  fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever .  and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes .  the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment .  but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal .  kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away .  seagal gallantly replies : " i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . "  i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background .  this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance .  seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) .  however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this .  still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity .  	negative
neg_155	 " gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that .  this movie is so stupid and dumb that it's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie .  i'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it .  it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death .  of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible .  actually , it's almost funny in a way .  the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him .  jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it .  what is the point of this ?  maybe she is one of the producer's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something .  we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating .  he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn't see that one coming ! ) ,  starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him .  if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank's grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . .  and gordy !  of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn't that evil .  he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story .  it's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker's are just this untalented and stupid .  at times " gordy " is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded " z- . "  but it's just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

neg_158	if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you !  indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them .  it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film .  but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show .  what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ?  first , the movie gives us an introductory premise .  huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared .  oooh . . . scary !  secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score .  third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) .  he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy .  finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him .  they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are .  during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs .  spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way .  little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster .  yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds .  this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film .  their realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat .  those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed .  the corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have .  yet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary " boo " moments .  but most of it is just outright silly .  and this film is unusually gory too .  monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains .  there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive .  he screams horribly as the monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away .  additionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films .  the mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock .  to be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was .  it's moronic fun at best .  so , if you're hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot .  	negative
neg_160	deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie .  this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive .  but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit .  braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) .  their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket .  however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables .  braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives .  braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie .  kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful .  the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises .  however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost .  take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled .  the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot .  for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable .  there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation .  they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay .  the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable .  not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught .  what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ?  writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound .  but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .  	negative
neg_167	so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again .  that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men , " 1995's " grumpier old men , " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i . e .   " grumpiest old men " ) .  so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e .   " the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series .  the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children .  oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .   .   .  then hilarity ensues .  well , a few chuckles ensue anyway .  neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end .  unlike the original play/movie , " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters .  instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert .  the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy .  it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since .  it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways .  the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie .  but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse .   ( you can add lemmon's " my fellow americans , " i . e .   " grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . )  let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do .  let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ) .  	negative
neg_169	maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there's a world of difference between artists and technicians .  the artist has a vision to create something new .  he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before .  a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox .  obviously successful films need both skills .  brian de palma is a masterful technician .  he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock .  he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .  aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead .  in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick .  to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called " 2001 " .  i enjoyed it even more when it was titled " close encounters " .  nasa has set its sights for mars .  when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet .  they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe .  and it's all so boring .  there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin .  when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from " dune " ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching .  error .  the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off .  error .  the alien is laughable .  error .  the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .  error .  there's some nice eyecandy .  the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool .  a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .  maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .  but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before .  from " 2001 " , there's the rotating space station , the blinding white room .  >from " close encounters " , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens .  the list goes on .  the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .  even gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .  no one seems to care about anything that happens .  you won't either .  the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day .  they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .  	negative
neg_170	mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .  as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .  it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .  in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .  toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .  the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .  something else is what he did .  the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .  she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .  meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .  she wants to build a career as an actress .  betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .  she does not know who the woman is .  she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .  they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .  meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .  he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .  these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .  there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .  in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .  a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .  lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .  he just chooses not to .  as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .  there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .  the film is a little long for the subject matter .  toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .  unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .  i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  mulholland drive spoiler warning .  i have rated this film fairly low .  you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .  david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .  most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .  in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .  what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )  playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .  the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .  then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .  the audience expectation is that they will add up .  but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .  lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .  in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .  there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .  mad magazine called it a poiuyt .  other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .  look at small portions of it and makes sense .  look at the whole figure and it does not .  this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .  	negative

"  the letter-writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens .  it's now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it's too late .  while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it's impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best .  there is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills .  it could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders .  it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film .  it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don't walk towards them yelling " hello " .  once you yell " hello " , you can expect an extreme close-up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse .  it's difficult to be in suspense when you know what's about to happen .  the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i'm not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks .  the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it .  	negative
neg_181	as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football .  those two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons .  first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death .  second , the sex is just bad .  despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing .  the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight .  cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer .  kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three .  unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) .  moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan .  most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most .  similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer .  these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic .  this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's " dawson's creek , " is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role .  other stars are similarly young and unmemorable .  there's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either .  everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .  this is certainly missable .  	negative

" end of days " aims to be an apocalyptic thriller .  it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which  makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining .  it's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a  big-budget slasher film .  arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world .  the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth .  tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom .  but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : " even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil . "  we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries .  the chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) .  it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot .  he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations .  but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body .  it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman .  he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it .  there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings .  the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value .  the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility .  mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 .  why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number " 666 , '' well !   . . .  satan's numeral is actually " 999 , '' which is upside down of " 666 . ''  accordingly , you just put a " 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get " 1999 . ''  with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult .  this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film .  i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose .  	negative
neg_192	poster boy for co-dependency needs patching  patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman  mediocrity is a pox on civilization .  in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out " stuff . "  what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ?  to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product .  the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .  the film industry is like any other .  in order for studios to survive , they have to make money .  the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .  some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used .  there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .  for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit .  often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones .  at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .  i'm not suggesting that " patch adams " was tossed out just to rake in the bucks .  my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .  it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be .  hunter " patch " adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis .  checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around .  patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency .  he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems .  he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia .  as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) .  the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students .  he writes in patch's academic file that he shows " excessive happiness . "  i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .  there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .  then it struck me .  it must be based on a true story .  the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic .  robin williams is an amazing actor .  while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits .  that's what makes his failure here so remarkable .  patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat .  something holds him back .  most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional .  for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters .  peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .  unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes .  the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .  we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them .  shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can't love because of her abusive history .  when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy " hey , let's put on a play !  we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! "  mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other .  there might as well be giant signs flashing : " feel good now ! "   " feel bad now ! "   " patch " is a good title for the film .  it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .  the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types .  there's a touching death .  then there's another .  the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time .  the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .  worst of all is the final courtroom bit .  scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .  the room is packed with patch's supporters .  williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .  it has as much emotion as his earlier statement " humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species " contains truth .  most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .  shadyac also directed the first " ace ventura " movie .  oedekerk directed the second one .  need i say more ?  the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .  the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .  the " doctors are not gods " theme will resonate with a number of people , but it's so poorly produced that no one will care .  	negative
neg_195	one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek .  following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace .  set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john " mox " moxon ( van der beek ) .  we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook .  coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him .  the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) .  also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin .  when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies .  his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end .  guess who wins ?  nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love .  there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow .  van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes .  also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character .  he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock .  voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out .  the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better .  on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) .  scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man .  larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening " whipped cream bikini . "  it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) .  all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture .  director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression .  the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it .  the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out .  there's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .  	negative
neg_196	susan granger's review of " america's sweethearts " ( columbia/sony )  what a waste of a talented cast !  billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy .  the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone .  he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected .   ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! )  for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) .  but the laughs are few and far-between .  crystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners .  after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma .  zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional .  only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth .  basically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " america's sweethearts " is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial .  	negative
neg_198	this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times .  it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam .  it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news .  the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped .  the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray .  ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement .  ray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business .  his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) .  the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you  should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them .  desperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a " sure thing " at freehold raceway .  the horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough .  there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray .  he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid .  so when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ?  the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do .  as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen .  his buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid .  and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together .  there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star .  because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn .  	negative
neg_200	capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .  visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film .  that makes it a film without much center .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .  it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels .  humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms .  the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .  it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .  when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .  the final irony of the original version has become film history .  without it there could never have been a " planet of the apes " film series .  i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .  in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .  that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .  serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .  justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .  but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .  few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .  partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .  when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .  while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .  the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .  now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .  for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful .  first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .  he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .  that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .  as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .  in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .  then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .   ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )  he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .  and the language they talk is earth- english .  apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .  the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .  both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .  in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .  outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .  leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .  ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .  she is bent on making the world a better place .  perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .  in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .  she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .  it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .  this is a further abandonment of the source material .  the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .  we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .  we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .  burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .  this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .  they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .  the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like " i never met an ape i didn't like , " but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .  most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .  the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .  this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .  in general it seems much improved from 1968 .  the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .  in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .  it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .  chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .  today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .  these visuals work nicely .  what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .  they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .  apes spring incredible distances .  some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .  one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .  since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .  the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .  it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .  but he delivers them very well .  he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .  as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .  in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .  he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .  as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .  danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .  that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .  i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  	negative
neg_210	the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images .  the tinkling christmas tree bell in " it's a wonderful life . "  bogie's speech at the airport in " casablanca . "  little elliott's flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in " e . t . "  and now , " starship troopers " director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug .   " starship troopers , " loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects .  in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale .  to put it simply , it's a bug bomb .  in " robocop " and " total recall , " verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and " starship troopers " starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise .  things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school .  inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial .  it's a veritable " alpha centuri 90210 " as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love .  michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities .  eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds .  one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( " doogie houser's " neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities .  he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg .  a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the " showgirls " director's camera roams over their buff bodies .  finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy .  the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space .  they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears .  yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts .  a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best .  sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter .  the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating .  the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension .  while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly .  verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children " doing their part for the war effort " by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck .  one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here .  his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders .  in " showgirls " fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good .  an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing " dixie " on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal .  a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying .   " it's okay , " she gasps , " i got to have you ! "  and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug .  it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel .  heinlein's pre- " stranger in a strange land " books were aimed at adolescent males , and " starship troopers " has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi .  the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting .  the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion .  ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant .  he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .  it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie .  avoid " starship troopers " at all costs .  	negative
neg_213	in " the astronaut's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly .  if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary's species . "  what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory .  ok , maybe " the astronaut's wife " deviates from " rosemary's baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man .  predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . "  theron's " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly .   " astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety .  last year's equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage .   " the astronaut's wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far .  here's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler's co-star in " big daddy . "  draw your own conclusions .  director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . "  cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell .  this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed " 's joe morton ) to instigate jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth .  his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge .  instead , he adds to the phoniness .  theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton's eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . "  undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut's wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs .  in space , no one can hear you scream .  but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore .  	negative
neg_220	at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today .  basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers .  how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture .  swordfish is loud , violent and amoral .  it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .  and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ?  by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists .  swordfish is a very cynical movie .  it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration .  the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is .  this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions .  the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign .  talk about whacked-out patriotism .  my objections to swordfish are many .  the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort .  it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits .  another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife .  stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl .  audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films .  thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve .  in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .  then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .  children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films .  there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well .  yea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it .  travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel .  his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off .  jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .  his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .  his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .  halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel .  swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel .  viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .  and maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive .  and that is not enough .  this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .  	negative
neg_232	shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen .  it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies .  that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort .  shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work .  the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books .  philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london .  it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan .  however , to directly quote the film , he has " cash flow problems . "  through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts .  so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production .  however , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well .  he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper .  then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block .  there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing .  the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author .  ironically , that couldn't be truer here .  the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors .  one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love .  so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits .  the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres .  joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though .  he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad .  gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well .  however , the supporting cast does almost save the day .  geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking .  they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links .  you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn't qualify as real acting . ) .  and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well .  but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances .  when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained .  however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn't necessarily quality .  and this certainly isn't quality .  perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work .  simply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .  	negative
neg_239	susan granger's review of " mulholland drive " ( universal focus )  whatever david lynch is selling , i'm not buying .  from the writer/director of " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills .  dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a '30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip .  the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase .  her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet .  the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust .  meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city .  the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered .  elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch .  the same cannot be said for former m . g . m .  dancer ann miller who's stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " mulholland drive " is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out .  	negative
neg_240	georges polti once wrote a paper called " the thirty-six dramatic situations , " in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations .  this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , " there's nothing new under the sun . "  the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion .  there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing .  drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall .  making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather " through the back door . "  parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day .  the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block .  even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach .  this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer .  although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive .  on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns .  only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers .  perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson's creek . "  needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be .  there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it .  in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .  	negative
neg_242	 " spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls .  sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while .  actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls .  but overall , who cares ?  not me .  if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood .  in " spice world " they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews .  amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money .  and they keep babbling about " girl power " when they should really be talking about " cleavage power " .  i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ?  the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film .  by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says " based on an idea by the spice girls " .  wow , they got idea credit !  i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . .  giving credit for simply having the thought " say girls , let's make a movie ! "  the supporting cast fares well .  roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing " chief " of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch .  mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) .  one question though : george wendt ?  you'd think that " spice world " would envoke one of two reactions in people .  if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards .  and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick .  oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film .  well , not the two who sat directly behind me .  they kept muttering " this is stupid " over and over again .  maybe there is hope for humanity after all .

neg_251	let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years .  i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight .  the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show .  when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt .  i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back .  when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv .  king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king .  after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view .  gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin .  yes , i do . . .  1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans .  he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously .  he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously .  i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 !  i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has .  2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret " the hitman " hart out of the title .  this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in .  eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .  3 .  the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him .  no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today !  4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ?  i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end .  5 .  in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan .  what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair .  wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ?  i hate that .  6 .  last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either .  the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons :  1 . they're the better promotion .  2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers .  3 .  they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots .  4 . they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about .  5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way .  the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end .  and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .  	negative
neg_253	hey , i've got a great idea for a movie !  ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so !  what's that ?  sounds too boring ?  ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i'm in pain ! "  looks !  what's that ?  that still doesn't sound funny to you ?  how about if we through in some " ewwwww ! "  looks ?  still not funny ?  if you answered " no , that doesn't sound funny " , then ( ding ding ding ! )  you're absolutely correct !  for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's " seinfeld " ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion .  what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell .  what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs .   .   .  namely , talent !  backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce .  just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names .  the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do .   .   .  except run away and join an amish community .  first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn .  alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) .  allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple !  this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning !  the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing .  it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get !  bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either .  in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first " power rangers " movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? !  now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it .  it bumped seven films up a notch on my " worst of " 1997 movie list .  that's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list .  if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all !  	negative
neg_254	even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves .  down periscope stars kelsey " frasier " grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy .  like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on .  then comes the transparent plotline .  first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .  after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone .  finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise .  and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability .  first they're singing " louie louie " like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off .  the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .  it's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it .  the jokes are right out of " mchale's navy " and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past .  there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , " this expired in 1966 ! "  i yelled back at the screen , " so did these jokes . "  i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it .  my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will .  the blame can't really be placed on the stars , though .  kelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn't have anything to work with .  his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had " welcome aboard " tatooed on his penis .  grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about .  same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous .  as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship .  my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster .  judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me .  the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson .  i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! "  without ever seeing it ) didn't like this .  	negative
neg_261	while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks .  and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year .  the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell .  todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .  not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while .  every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student .  the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life .  al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him .  the next element in the film is the part when things go awry .  and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al .  as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene .  inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away .  hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world " is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again .  so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife .  time passes .  and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . .  this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla .  now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil .  and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly .  john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point .  all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners .  and then there's martin sheen .  whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years .  his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent .  as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot .  this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street .  i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape .  spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable .  for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better .  it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie .  continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made .  perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry .  the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible .  the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting .  it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act .  but bruce wayne had human elements to him .  he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human .  the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal .  and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary .  none of this is present in spawn .  the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's .  as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .  admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum .  it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature .  besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .  movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to .  and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .  children are not muppets .  and spawn unapologetically targets children .  	negative
neg_264	if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat .  so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) .  my , how easily does the worm turn .  hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .  at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included .  and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . .  boring .  although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness .  _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .  these characters are about as generic as those descriptions .  in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .  with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) .  as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .  what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?  even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .  dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault .  from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend .  but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .  aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .  shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .  this tacked-on " romance " would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .  they fail on both counts .  ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n .  as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience .  too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .  anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .  when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) .  strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .  there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them .  they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 .  these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made .  the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .  	negative
neg_269	if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it .  if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : " shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . "  but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say .  so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie .  you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly .  sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever .  admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies .  so do i .  so i saw " supernova . "  truth be told , " supernova " wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be .  maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed .  maybe i'm becoming a softy .  in any case , i didn't find " supernova " as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe .  but it's still bad .  the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel " nightingale . "  the crew includes captain a . j .  marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) .  there are some attempts at " characterization , " but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) .  don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it .  anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent .  during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board .  he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with .  then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening .  have you seen " alien ? "  have you seen " event horizon " ( a lame movie in its own right ) ?  good .  then you've seen " supernova . "  post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either .  after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain .  but the bigger problem with " supernova " is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded .  numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped .  was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ?  did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ?  what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ?  and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ?  as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements .  character relationships in this film also make very little sense .  for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex .  we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes .  bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other .  fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky .  when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him .  every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut .  the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits !  furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits .  maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster .  right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations .  the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby .  point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing .  doesn't make sense .  since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ?  not a whit .  it's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do .  they don't find it .  bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces .  sexual tension ?  more like constipation .  maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as " this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . "  not that we ever find out who that is , mind you .  the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper .  as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected .  he' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with .  the rest of the cast does even less .  tunney stands around looking cute , then scared .  phillips broods .  cruz flirts with the computer .  then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then .   " supernova " is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got .  that's it .  if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will .  even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film .  honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ?  it usually results in a bad movie , and that's what " supernova " is .  	negative
neg_271	the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits .  the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is .  last year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory .  in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer .  whatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .  julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion .  julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) .  will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics .  unfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook .  it's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending .  there's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel .  for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer .  the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing .  the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments .  much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .  the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem .  and , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically .  three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as " the killer . "  they're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show .  and so , in the end , it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast .  god help us .  	negative
neg_272	i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work .  he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain .  with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope .  what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here .  the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to .  but where are the thrills ?  the laughs ?  both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge .  and what a shame that is .  i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty .  kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office .  teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign .  or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties .  i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past .  the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren .  mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils .  the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members .  i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way .  mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink .  in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work .  the plot is a big problem here .  material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director .  the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship .  but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable .  later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam .  leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it .  alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning .  in the morning . . .  how convenient !  the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name .  things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle .  the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her .  of course , not everything goes entirely to plan .  besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress .  there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved .  the humor is completely inconsistent .  after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze .  you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace .  a moment like that never arises .  williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor .  and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely .  on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher .  while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable .  there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script .  mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching .  she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom .  if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' .  basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here .  his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) .  we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real .  	negative
neg_273	a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama .  it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past .  the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) .  her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst .  her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin .  he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city .  out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about .  the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws .  chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk .  the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .  to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator .  the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book " the shovel and the loom , " goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .  it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten .  the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters .  the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted .  the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith .  topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .  the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder .  but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done .  i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story .  it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received .  in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past .  that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about .  unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .  	negative
neg_276	 * * the following review contains spoilers * *   " please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . "  -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal  i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin .  apparently , no one heard my words .  oh , how i wish you had heard them .  oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . .  because he's done it again .  the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale .  in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not .  in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government .  keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves .  he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well ) .  he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery .  after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe .  it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera .  the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film .  so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film .  the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless .  welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) .  when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing .  the choice of casting does the film in .  then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him .  the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet .  so your first instinct has now been confirmed .  then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous " since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing " moments ) .  but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended .  huh ?  also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back .  so why did he give it up in the first place ? !  the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? !  it's totally absurd . . .  and this is the screenwriter of seven ?  late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car .  cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table .  james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of " suspense " .  you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching .  go around to the other side of the car ! !  this goes on for minutes .  then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car .  boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves .  i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn !  we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .  other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that .  whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it .  awful decision there joel .  another is cage's performance .  at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad .  for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) .  you're capable of much better mr . cage .  now as for you mr . schumacher . . .  i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

neg_280	capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness .  potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring .  claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice .  it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e .  movie , where s . f . e .  means so f * * * ing earnest .  movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing .  claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk .  claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat .  claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior .  obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk .  the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness .  the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand .  the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively .   ( ugh ! )  the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads .  all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened .  we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet .  the problem with claire . . .  is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled .  why is it that any " serious " ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ?  the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids .  many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting .  look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire .  what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants .  	negative

neg_287	tv's buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in " simply irresistible . "  sarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals .  taste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up .   " simply irresistible " is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on .  gellar's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public's in her tiny tribeca eatery .  all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993's mexican classic " like water for chocolate . "  several differences : one , " like water " didn't have a telekinetic crab , and two , " like water " was a good film .   " simply irresistible , " on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven .  amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish .  the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it's not like you're were going to miss much .  in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it .  but a majority of " simply irresistible " 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there's just no fun rooting for their inevitable " happily ever after . "  nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it's not going to last long , people .  perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don't go anywhere either .  in fact , nothing in " simply irresistible " goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn't go somewhere so much as you wish she'd go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie .  already proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she's the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn't completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return .  it's certainly a dish best not served in it's current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , " simply irresistible " would be strictly unwatchable .  	negative
neg_289	i've heard it called " jaws with claws " and that's a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality .  director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century .  they've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music .  the movie doesn't make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest .  in fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you've stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie .  how about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can't even hit the damned thing ?  or the ham-on-wry acting of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ? ?  or , my favorite , lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops ? ! ?  	negative

'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill .  the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's  humans .  that should teach us for squishing all those bugs .  what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace .  perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become .  if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest .  the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie .  there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking .  if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense .  in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them .  there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch .  the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them .  the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average .  sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really .  the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever .  their reasonable good fun , however .  mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good .  like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content .  it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well .  but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong .  a good opportunity , then , wasted .  a shame .  overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998  	negative
neg_300	your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : it's heavily christmas-themed and its release date is , oh , say , at the end of february .  your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : charlize theron , one of the movie's dubious stars , makes an appearance on the daily show in which , when asked if her new movie's any good , she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh . . .  assuring us that , yeah , it sure is a movie , all right !  and there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie , and there's some action . . .  and there's other . . .  stuff . . .  too .  how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits .  then show a caption reading " six days earlier . . . "  ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas . . .  how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene .  write a line for the one of prisoners like " i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad . "  then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor .  for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck's best buddy stabbed . . .  aw . . .  and just two days before his release , too .  already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours .  how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling " shotgun " about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think .  have ben affleck , for some reason i'll never understand , pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron .  have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist .  the villains' big idea ?  kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some " diversions " and rob the place .  on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller .  it's not like the man isn't capable . . .  far from it .  he's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may .  he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i've ever seen in last year's ronin .  but he's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . .  put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau .  step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero .  he gets no good one-liners , he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie .  his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood .  see , it's called reindeer games .  get it ?  get it ?  shut up . )  in the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man .  step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with .  he's dirty and potty-mouthed , he's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them .  he's also extremely inept at what he does .  he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck's character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him .  but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he's playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script .  [on a side note , gary sinise wins this week's " title ! "  award , as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings .  last week's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ]  how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely .  this is a bad movie .  and what's worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad .  if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained .  	negative
neg_304	tomb raider .  fun ?  exciting ?  challenging ?  given the unprecedented popularity ( especially among teenage boys ) of the video game that sports an uber-buff , pistol packin' babe who raids , well . . .  tombs , you have to believe it's these three things and more !   " lara croft : tomb raider , " the big screen variant of said video game , which features a pumped-up angelina jolie ( the oscar ? winner for " girl , interrupted " no less ) in the title role is , however , none of these things .  it isn't fun , it isn't exciting , and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffered through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opted for barnes & noble at the 45-minute mark ) .  directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to " con air , " " tomb raider " is an empty-headed , big budget bore .  the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys " hudson hawk " ( the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that , when brought together , well . . .  who the heck cares ? ) and it makes " super mario bros . " ( bob hoskins' ill-advised career move ) look like " rocco and his brothers " ( that classic of italian neo-realism ) .  i'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there's actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper .  this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt ( or bum , since ms . croft hails from england's green and pleasant ) .  with lips , breasts , and biceps all inflated to the max , lara croft is all about posturing , and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough .  ok , let's forget challenging .  shouldn't " tomb raider " be , at the very least , fun and exciting ?  shouldn't our butt-kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of , say , james bond with the wit of indiana jones ?  there's no humor to be found anywhere in " tomb raider , " even though it tries hard from time to time .  even " the mummy returns " didn't take itself too seriously .  the villain here is noticeably lacking , the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated , and the script is non-existent .  to liven things up ( perhaps ) , jolie's live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara's dead father lord croft ; talk about a stretch .  one thing i hadn't expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa ( although i suspect that thin-looking moustache he's forced to wear gets in the way some ) .  unsuccessful ? not entirely .  if anything , " lara croft : tomb raider " makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about .  	negative
neg_305	walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia .  but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about .  disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules .  with anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window .  some may say - so what ?  it's just a kid's movie .  well . . .  if you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way .  consider yourselves warned .  nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times .  don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality .  and yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . .  was this rushed to market to combat disney ?  the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 .  not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened .  as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe .  you'll see 60% of anastasia there .  	negative
neg_311	drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn't fit in with the others .  she has perfected these characters in movies such as " the wedding singer " and , most notably , " ever after . "  now she's back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - " never been kissed . "  you know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary .  trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don't mean steve ) invented the printing press .  the premise is simple .  barrymore's josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today's teens are feeling and doing .  josie ( she says she was named after the '70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance .  this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd .  now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence .  these are among the many problems that plague " never been kissed . "  screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie .  their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation .  and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school's most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability .  ok , so " never been kissed " is not a sociological expose of today's high school scene .  however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character .  among the movie's problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment .  any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say " get me rewrite . "  to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with .  she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her .  barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler .  otherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes and situations .   " never been kissed " is entertaining and funny in fits and starts .  it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish .  the movie's main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie .  josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls .  real mature .  and that is the main deficiency with " never been kissed . "  it's illogical , unrealistic , uneven and undemanding .  it has some warm and humorous spots , but not enough to overcome its many obstacles .  	negative
neg_312	 " come on , silent bob !  we're going to hollywood . "  starring jason mewes , kevin smith , will ferrell , shannon elizabeth , seann william scott , chris rock , jason lee , ben affleck .  directed by kevin smith .  rated r .  jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior .  kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic .  but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission .  jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith's movies but , if i'm not mistaken , have not starred in one until now .  they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood .  this presents two problems : a ) they haven't received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( " what's the internet ? " )  are talking trash about them .  what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ?  on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ?  -- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits .  of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film .  will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey .  the movie will probably please only smith's die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past .  any appeal the movie has will come from the " in " jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is " in " to the point of absurdity .  there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness .  once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire .  countless " hot " movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer .  get it ?  they're so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey !  a monkey !  as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat .  one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : " the female clitoris ? "  kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film .  unfortunately , it's also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny .  smith's " verbal trampoline , " as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker .  this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible .  	negative
neg_319	a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) .  to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .  	negative

( you waited 10 years , what's another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? ) .  i'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why !  and many , many more .  ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ?  i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke .  and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions .  badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone .  in fact , if it wasn't for brittany murphy's excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito's embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right !  watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn't supposed to be ) and michael douglas' cool " regular guy " part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture .  incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ?  she was completely superfluous .  and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow .  ooooh , thanks , mr . fleder . . . i  appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude . . . yum ,  yum . . . but  how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ?  whatever .  either way , i don't give a rat's ass because this movie is a dog and that's unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it .  see it if you like dumb thrillers .  incidentally , if you appreciated along came a spider , you will likely enjoy this film as well .  they both start off with interesting premises , only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through .  where's joblo coming from ?  along came a spider ( 4/10 ) - girl , interrupted ( 5/10 ) - kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) - primal fear ( 7/10 ) -- seven ( 10/10 )  	negative
neg_324	i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world .  and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it .  writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning .  convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every " thou shalt not " of the ten commandments into a " thou shalt " ( and vice versa ) .  his wife's sister rachel ( " friends " ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic .  thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion .  taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him .  composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain .  the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage .  the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot .  it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .  corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth's " false witness .

neg_333	as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients .  he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony .  and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer .  in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal .  his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) .  he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division .  lomax is soon given the case of his life .  he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide .  the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell .  he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) .  but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story .  it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed .  but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm .  quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago .  freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed .  the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts .  the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer .  the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax .  unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere .  granted , the film is very handsome-looking .  you'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino .  you'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties .  you'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away .  this was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot .  as with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst .  in the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background .  his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored .  his actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known .  pacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie .  there is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited .  the focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap .  this movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time .  however , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all .  	negative
neg_337	depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal .  but in case you didn't know this , don't bother remembering it . . .  the words " original sin " never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it .  the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) .  regardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) .  boy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife .  since this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful .  skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie's breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills .  original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller .  we see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her .  but as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money .  girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the " other man , " a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place .  add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year .  don't even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal .  just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it's much worse than a sin .  this is sacrilege .  	negative

neg_349	old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches  soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body .  jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both .  often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes .  without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams .  warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy .  they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle .  this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies .  america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers .  todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype .  chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine .  his childhood is cruelty and competition .  he is indoctrinated with the big rules .  never question authority .  winning is everything .  strength beats knowledge .  a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete .  a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger .  left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world .  obviously our hero is still alive .  he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health .  when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world .  they are the other good guys .  these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons .  todd finds himself in the role of protector .  what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon .  the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion .  the plot is old hat .  we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers .  hardly anything makes sense .  the film's science fares badly .  with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid .  after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away .  even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines .  virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 .  there is nothing in the story that is not predictable .  the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him .  it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer .  is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ?  who would you guess wins ?  some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy .  todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse .  later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion .  supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous .  dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash .  responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic " the fifth element " , director paul anderson sees the film as " shane " in outer space .  maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode .  the movie doesn't even work as an action film .  there is never a question as to the outcome .  somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd .  the acting isn't anything to write home about .  nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim .  russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge .  uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space .  gary busey as todd's commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role .  everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool .  sometimes the sets are impressive .  unfortunately " occasionally " and " sometimes " don't make a film .  most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote " blade runner " , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made .  sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film .  peoples says that this is not a " blade runner " sequel , but a " sidequel " that takes place in the same universe .  although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the " blade runner " replicants watch to pass time .  perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .

neg_352	can you say " dated " ?  you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release .   " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too .  rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .  it all seems so harmless in the beginning .  mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .   ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration . )  their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .  all's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out .  when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .  it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .  and everyone's helping with the pregnancy .  the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66 . 6  years .  meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .  before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries .  that's when you know your health's failing .  the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma .  by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way .  rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .  i guess someone put a spell on this movie .  	negative
neg_356	the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles .  it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update .  nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : " quality " films ) compete for audiences .  alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season .  it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic .  i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment .  are critics so desperate for something unique that they're blind to how derivative the particular brand of " uniqueness " betty dolls out is ?  for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material .  betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation .  it's labute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it .  nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) .  she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities .  she's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love .  betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit .  the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime .  the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things " average " people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are .  in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim " boys will be boys " .  another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby !  what was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic .  obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it .  he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience .  nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue .  they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) .  i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show .  surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks .  that wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body .  it's the best work she's ever done .  freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it .  the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality .  that's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle .  the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing .  the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke .  betty's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn't make any progress in the film .  nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think .  betty has an interesting theme , though it doesn't even seem aware of this .  the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way .  this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) .  instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .  	negative

neg_358	wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy .  there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group .  this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core .  wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 .  i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch .  wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story .  what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists .  everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie .  the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it .  using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once .  that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner .  the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex .  both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected .  nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? .  the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat .  the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound .  theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad " no nudity " clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) .  the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower .  maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs .  kevin bacon ) is familiar with .  the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life .  that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script .  it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker .  but i suppose we all need to put food on the table .  mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) .  quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws .  the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school .  a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him .  one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn .  after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) .  they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale .  meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help .  the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with .  this is definitely not a character- based motion picture .  not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth .  the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more .  matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps .  neve campbell gets to model the slutty look .  denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit .  and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon .  the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) .  columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ?  wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by .  thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing .  but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .  	negative

"  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "  however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  	negative
neg_369	renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller .  tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances .  writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little .  van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans .  it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . .   . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ .  while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting " skills " of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) .  a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : " i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "  and " entrepreneurship , babycakes ! "  standing out among my favorites .  but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs .  van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual .  early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way .  even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug .  paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode .  in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage .  tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work .  here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise .  for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous .  this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context .  for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box .  as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen .  it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something .  the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired .  tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza .  there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) .  if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . .  before it's too late .  if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . .  that is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco .  	negative
neg_372	there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it .  then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes .  writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category .  weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters , herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories .  hitmen lee ( james spader ) and his partner dosmo ( danny aiello ) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox ( teri hatcher ) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked .  an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops , ( jeff daniels ) and wes ( eric stoltz ) .  a murder is not vice territory , flirting with asian prostitues is , but wes would rather play inquisitive detective .  meanwhile , washed-up director , teddy ( paul mazursky ) is about to end his life .  but before he can do that , he must find a good home for his dog .  enter nurse audrey ( marsha mason ) , who takes the dog and teddy for a ride .  stuffy art dealer , allan hopper ( greg cruttwell ) has kidney stones .  while struggling about his fancy house , he switches between moaning in self-pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary's ( glenne headly ) plain appearance .  don't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on .  you might like that feeling of cluelessness .  herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes .  the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though .  the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts , even though they are interesting and funny .  funny , that is if you aren't comparing them to the likes of tarantino's pulp chcaracters .  the tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of ( director's name ?  guy who also did last seduction ) red rock west .  two days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters .  it'll keep you guessing alright but you won't remember the answers five minutes after the credits .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  	negative
neg_373	warning : may contain slight mild spoilers .  rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language .  starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne .  running time : 132 minutes  we go into a movie theater , boom !  the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on .  we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is .  why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into .  again like this past summers hit " stigmata " , " end of days " may be worse .  it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some " rosemary's baby " , along with " the devil's advocate " a little " exorcist " and some " stigmata " here and there .  whala you have " end of days " a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific .  sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers .  the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next .  jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist .  he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes .  he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie .  that's pretty much it on plot .  it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went .  as for arnie ?  good role , ok performance .  i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts .  the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film .  in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions .  gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in " stigmata " ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character .  two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun " the devil's advocate " and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also .  robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child .  of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new .  the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in " stigmata " .  here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie .  the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home .  only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well .  the sad thing is that " end of days " had so many things going for it .  the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing .  at times it seems like " armageddon " and started to get old and tiresome .  hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i've always said before needs new ones .  even with its 100m budget " end of days " is less than pleasing .  in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget .  maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original .  we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office .  we need to get more films like " the blair witch project " that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch .  overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm  yup those pretty much describe " end of days " .  	negative
neg_376	robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style .  overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) .  so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble .  jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically " uplifting " film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it .  williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii .  one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment .  jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast .  the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant " heil hitler ! " ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto .  liberation ! he thinks .  the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along .  soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death .  this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate .  the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger .  in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home .  apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear .  he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning .  the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine .  but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false .  such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope .  that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false .  it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by .  jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing .  robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent .  he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless .  not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love .  in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it .  here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor .  jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a " holocaust comedy " .  it's not a comedy .  it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works .  is it a melodrama ?  a war movie ?  a character study ?  no , no , and no .  jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts .  	negative
neg_379	in my review of " the spy who shagged me , " i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore .  the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing .   " scream 3 " provides the latest proof of this rule .  in los angeles production has begun on " stab 3 : return to woodsboro , " the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) .  however , life soon starts imitating art , and " stab " cast members turn up stabbed .  smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in " stab 3 . " elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name .   .   .  until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice .  the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy .  he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with .  indeed , " scream 3 " tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original " scream . "  at the scene of each murder in " scream 3 , " the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer .  to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films .   ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) .  unlike its predecessors , " scream 3 " doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer .  the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is .  the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ?  the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ?  the driven young director ( scott foley ) ?  the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ?  the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random .  wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen .  the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious .  possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche .  i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first " scream " was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home .  at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas .   " scream 3 " also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles .  look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from " seinfeld " ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point .  all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- " scream " job search .  another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying " the blair witch project " 's web strategy .   " scream 3 " has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie .  the sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the " latest 'stab 3' news . "  there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more " stab " scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) .  craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the " scream " series .  while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters .  there's a " halloween h2k " in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in " h20 , " and a " freddy vs . jason " has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were " killed off . "  there's bound to be a " scream 4 " someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes .  bottom line : they should have called this one " yawn . "  	negative
neg_380	i want to be involved in show business one day .  and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse .  this movie proves it for me .  i was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up .  i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne .  they didn't .  kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles .  this film is different .  the cast is still impressive , but here , not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction ( he's one of those directors who's good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn't really give an impressive cast anything to do .  the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy .  the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze .  his accent is so heavy , you can't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice .  that's the trouble with me , * i * notice .  schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does .  patrick stewart was the person i'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would've been so much better .  or sean connery , but not arnold " i'm not an actor , but i play one in real life " schwarzenegger .  i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would've been nice if they'd casted a star that had talent for the role .  akiva goldsmith's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film .  in a regular batman film , they'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson's julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is .  there is talk of a fifth batman movie .  my interest to see it is low , but i hope it's better than this .  if you don't want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster .  any other .  	negative
neg_383	 " holy man " boasts a sweet , gentle , comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits .  unfortunately , to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set-up , loads of tedious filler , interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching , a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia's career .  if ever a movie screamed " wait for video so you can fast-forward through all the dull and annoying parts , " this is it .  eddie murphy plays g , a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message .  a chance meeting with ricky hayman ( goldblum ) , a stressed-out executive of a home-shopping channel , and kate newell ( kelly preston ) , a no-nonsense media analyst , results in physical injury to g . quicker than you can say " the odd couple , " g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky .  after some script gymnastics , g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network , wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations , enraging network owner mr . mcbainbridge ( loggia ) , and becoming a national media sensation .   " holy man " attempts to be several things at once .  it tries to satirize home shopping networks , but it's difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a self-parody .  the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts , but that's common knowledge already .   " holy man " also tries to present a story of redemption , as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit g's good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career .  anyone want to place a wager on his final decision ?  the one genuine asset in " holy man " is eddie murphy , who gives a charming performance , sharing love , good will and relevant advice to all those around him , while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments .  murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he's onscreen .  unfortunately , he's not onscreen enough .  jeff goldblum gets the lion's share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down .  as his potential love interest , kelly preston tries to brighten things up , but she transforms from an all-business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance .  the other principal actor , robert loggia , wastes his talents in a one-note turn as a ruthless , screaming monster .  structurally unsound and way too long , " holy man " is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn't .  instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle , wait until it hits video and fast-forward past everything except the murphy scenes .  g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and that's the best way to do so .  	negative
neg_384	it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy .  and no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office .  really , i don't .  not at all .  the plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it .  the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ?  in the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore .  she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott .  he , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him .  after a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) .  kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) .  to add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits .  supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing .  their purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone .  to do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting .  rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them .  this is the love letter's damning error .  capshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional .  because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere .  even worse -- it's a bore .  i liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist .  there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing .  this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities .  but it's far from profound .  there isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless .  really , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through .  but bad , it is .  awful , it also is .  the love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  	negative
neg_386	some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr .  magoo being a prime example .  the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images .  if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection .  for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan .  the story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject .  mr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it .  mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased .  like home alone 3 but without any class , mr .  magoo can only be described as painfully bad .  fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity .  the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off .  when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace .  mr .  magoo provides only three such moments .  the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm .  the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog .  angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture .  finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked .  rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon .  he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny .  my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky .  hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not .  mr . magoo runs 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages .  my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie .  he said he liked home alone 3 much more .  his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense .  his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .  	negative
neg_391	yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex .  neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ?  ok !  yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes .  wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however .  nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie .  but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises .  we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making .  guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts .  right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce " mr . lombardo " .  the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done .  on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day .  naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations .  but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor .  pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray .  yes , that bill murray !  sound like a good , complete movie ?  yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning .  in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film .  it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time .  by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable .  unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about .  this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been .  the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken .  the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing .  and it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap " party of five " , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones .  dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film .  in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade .  that's how cheezy it comes off .  but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's .  in the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting .  and what's up with these people passing as high school students ?  i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker .  i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure .  as corny as it is , it's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a " b " for effort .  but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better .  of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you'll be right at home with wild things .  perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .  	negative
neg_392	i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws .  but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american .  or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence .  this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role .  if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work .  although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself .  this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) .  in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind .  it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail .  it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful .  yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch .  he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison .  his cell , food and rights  all terrible .  now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder .  jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .   as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered .  red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes .  what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act .  this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption .  but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch .  if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible .  it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before .  if that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions .  shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself .  taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be .  although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway .  whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again .  martin vailwhere are you ?  	negative
neg_397	at the end of an action scene in " lara croft : tomb raider , " a wall collapses near the nubile warrior .  with her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says " oh , my car keys ! "  i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile .  based on an incredibly popular video game , " lara croft : tomb raider " is a lousy movie .  the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end .  basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits .  close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms .  running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage " baywatch " fashion .  there's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them .  but the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly .  the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy .  for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la " austin powers . "  now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ?  of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ?   " tomb raider " sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) .  it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies .  throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons .  intended to be a rousing " indiana jones " style adventure , " tomb raider " lacks any sense of tension .  the low point comes when lara is " threatened " by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi .  easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun .  if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors .   " tomb raider " tells a story , sort of .  once every 5 , 000 years , the planets align .  a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself .  lara's goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie's real life dad ) .  none of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of " lara croft : tomb raider " is as lame as ever other aspect of the film ? except angelina jolie's lips and breasts .  	negative
neg_400	the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican .  his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires .  they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them .  valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself .  for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross .  with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight .  after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . .  i have never liked john carpenter and his style .  after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed .  john carpenter remains john carpenter .  however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time .  neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original .  but there are some things that are interesting .  the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance .  at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life .  otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy .  carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere .  set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness .  more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil .  the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement .  music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice .  when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing .  he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the " breed of evil " .  woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance .  daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner .  the other cast members are struggling .  because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat .  still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience .  	negative
neg_402	in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .  his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake .  the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes .  hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .  whichever one you like , dear , he says .  and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries .  i liked that scene for two reasons .  first , the cakes looked really cool .  second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act .  meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot .  it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .  the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .  i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .  case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .  however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .   ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )  it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt .  and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .  well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .  so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately .  anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .  the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .  if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society .  it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .  he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .  he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .  he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .  and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there .  it's as if someone told pitt , " never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . "  it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .  i've used the phrase " angel of death " in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels .  where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .  where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .  cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks .  the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .  he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .   ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . )  hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .  of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .  but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .  hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .  fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure .  i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why .  movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now .  go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .  don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .  -- curtis edmonds   " no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

neg_405	arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse .  it's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ?  once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser .  in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) .  with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world !  parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma .  yes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film .  anyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie .  it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing .  sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going .  it's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources .  aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films .  i'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days .  speaking of action , where was it in this film ?  there was hardly any explosions or fights .  the devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt .  the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film .  i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down .  i also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much .  there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget .  the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom .  it's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie .  do they even read these things anymore ?  it sure doesn't seem like it .  thankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film .  when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil .  the guy is creepy looking anyway !  when it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie .  don't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action .  it's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign .  save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience .  	negative
neg_407	gordie boggs ( arquette , aptly cast as a moron , as he is one ) and his best friend sean dawkins ( scott caan .  the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this ! ) are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends , who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king ( a terribly casted oliver platt ) , as he is everything they are not .  they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil , ruthless promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff , whose name was written all over the role ! ) .  gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him , but a drunken , ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry , darryl , and darryl .  they sneak him back onto wcw tv , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw's next pay-per-view , against his rival , diamond dallas page .  if he wins , king gets his title and his career back , plus one million dollars .  wcw president eric bischoff , knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation , came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw .  he was then fired and rehired two months ago , but by the time he'd left , they had already been contracted to do the film , and bischoff could not play sinclair ( which , in itself , is for the best , as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor ! ) .  the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans .  he thinks of them as young , dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real .  that is why he doesn't take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay-per-view .  i have news for you , eric : no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn't for show , unless they are four years old .  this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 .  bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy , but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic , rocky-style film ( which it probably should have been .  professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is , why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy ? ) , gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light .  anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows , documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon's double-crossing of bret hart , will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble , that it is basically a rip-off of that film's storyline with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect .  you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince , but any self-respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .  all of these aspects of the film , needless to say , seriously offended me as a wrestling fan .  another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan ) .  wouldn't it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair's insistance ?  i hate that cliche !  the world wrestling federation would have made a better film .  they are the promotion everyone cares about , they are winning the ratings , they have better wrestlers , and they take their fans into consideration and don't treat fans like morons .  so , vince , how about a movie ?  	negative
neg_408	when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august .  happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater .  unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory .  worse , actually .  fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read " laura palmer's secret diary . "  for " twin peaks " junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved .  the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish .  the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon .  the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper .  lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later .  ah , twin peaks : " familiar territory , " you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in .  wrong !  the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't .  only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos .  the rest of the " twin peaks " cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town .  cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna .  the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth .  the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence .  we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere .  her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful " twin peaks " viewers .  but it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie .  	negative
neg_411	confucius once said , " governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don't overdo it . "  his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make .  granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series " beavis and butt-head " was pure gold for its network ) .  but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground .  the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal .  in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon " dilbert , " which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood .  unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of " saturday night live " rather than a full-length feature .  the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated .  other evidence of office space's failure to work are its lack of good jokes .  the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud .  the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here .  however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse .  the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech .  after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of " downsizing " the company's payroll .  when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall .  the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but .  a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent .  	negative
neg_415	it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar .  why ?  the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' .  i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' .  but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster .  this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel .  you have been warned .  of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation .  brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off .  when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) .  of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . .  all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood .  that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient .  if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole .  sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration .  the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) .  after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet .  suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction .  for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art .  the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive .  immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars .  let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there .  it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months .  i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia .  instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship .  what happened during the five months prior to this ?  did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ?  still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak .  depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ?  c'mon ) .  there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud .  it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists .  as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . .  maybe even cheated .  after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen .  others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . '  okay , it did suck .  but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . .  after all , they do pretty well .  sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) .  the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive .  so , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ?  looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have .  while watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off .  	negative
neg_416	despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances .  so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is .  it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse .  something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) .  the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) .  this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find .  meanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes .  it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive .  it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does .   " this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! "  exclaims one character in the early going .  in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong .  the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected .  looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's " black cancer " to me .  but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from .  species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did .  human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) .  a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ?  aliens sans flamethrowers .  the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here .  after the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge .  however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment .  at one point she's called on to play alien " empath " ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell .  by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch .  so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard .  one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control .  the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that .  helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along .  williamson suffers the worst indignity .  he tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as " i'm gonna get african on someone's ass " and not appear ridiculous ?  but species ii's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work .  at least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's , for a start .  but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level .  for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore .  	negative
neg_422	 " spawn " may be somewhat of an older film .  in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) .  but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing .  it wasn't the worst film of year by any means .  it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year .  but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list .  the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year .  performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy .  in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness !  even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality .  i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed .   .   .  well , annoyingly unprofessional .  john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite .  he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional .  but the main problem i found with " spawn " , as with most films that wind up on my " worst of " lists , is that it was just plain boring .  i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film .  sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion .  never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way .  even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again .  like i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small .  i was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me .  and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created .  but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game .  who knows if " spawn : the video game " wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ?  keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all .  but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission .  this movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing .  if you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be !  trust me !   " spawn " has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers !  	negative
neg_423	from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli .  hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors .  nice to see you , jim .  as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ?  jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago .  one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video .  it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature .  i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland .  now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks .  actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise .  hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field .  leading off this inning is john warren .  he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one .  wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ?  what's it about ?  jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell .  when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to " the show . "  with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track .  in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) .  soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch .  wh : can we guess who wins ?  jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score .  on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair .  they're not just boring ; they're lackluster .  but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs .  hc : warren fouls off a fastball .  1 and 1 .  wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ?  jb : not one , from start to finish .  i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny .  okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh .  the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low .  even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing .  hc : here's the 1-1 pitch .  looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball !  the count goes to 1 and 2 .  wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ?  jb : yes .  there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural .  but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor .  heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors .  wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ?  like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn .  jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back .  there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs .  yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ?  they have no depth .  notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's " wild thing . "  we don't really miss them , though .  hc : breaking ball , low and outside .  2 and 2 .  wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ?  jb : that's right .  to use baseball terminology , it's a three-pitch strikeout .  if you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr .  actually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters .  even the minor league seasons are already underway .  don't bother with major league : back to the minors .  it's a wretched time- waster .  wh : thanks for the advice .  jb : you're welcome .  hc : and here's the 2-2 pitch .  fouled back , right into this booth .  hey , jim , heads up !  oops .  somebody better get him some ice for that .  he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls .  odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle .  anyway , back to the action on the field ?  	negative
neg_424	it's time to take cover .  after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest .  in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar .  of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video .  the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town .  the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption .  flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people .  we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing .  it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road .  symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that .  we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred .  harry survived , but his wife did not .  a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) .  there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop .  although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are .  they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak .  they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug .  however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath .  thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption .  this film contains a number of cliches .  the amorous couple is one .  as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die .  the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog .  countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable .  watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well .  unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible .  for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation .  paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm .  this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work .  when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , " cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . "  even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving .  he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water .  if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked .   " is that your recipe for frog soup ? "  asks one of the team members .   " it's my recipe for disaster , " responds harry .  dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious .  our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid .  mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , " acid eats metal . "  thanks for the tip .  when we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such .  this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , " u . s . geological survey . "  i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs .  although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why .  there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this .  when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ?  were they even attracted to each other ? "  if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act .  who does he think he is ?  james bond ?  the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed .  there are several " warning signs " prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything .  for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot .  a tremor occurs .  does he plunge headlong to his death ?  is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ?  no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg .  the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well .  it wasn't .  one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak .  in a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster .  it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved .  if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way .  in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough .  maybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one .  for no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt .  perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate .  there are a couple of good things about this movie .  the first is the scenery .  there are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful .  the second is the special effects .  they are the closest i've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption .  but when elements which don't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you'd probably better rewrite the script .  	negative
neg_425	capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything .  a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with .  it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why .  right from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible .  a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead .  after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial .  mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics .  the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have .  sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box .  the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part .  i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact .  there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this .  because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting .  one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic .  i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter .  the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes .  first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma .  he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade .  the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story .  it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics .  another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character .  i'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible .   ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . )  is jackson's character then simply insane ?  that prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either .  one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information .  mcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense .  how did the prosecution get this information ?  how come he didn't get it ?  the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion .  this is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters .  it's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending .  at two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter .  it's all handwaving .  the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair .  it's not easy to make a movie about something .  the other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) .  a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time .  	negative
neg_429	 " ladybugs " is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield .  this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ?  and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ?  rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation .  he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team .  what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less .  i didn't laugh , but for some reason it didn't annoy me that much .  chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams .  jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) .  what we get is just another retread of the " underdog sports team " mixed with some cross dressing .  unfortunately , the film isn't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect .  in fact , it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable .  could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ?  he only wears a girl's wig , without any makeup , and they don't even give him falsies .  brandis doesn't bother to mimic a girl's voice either .  then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ?  martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ?  just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on .  when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss .  this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) .  there's just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters .  i've seen worse movies than " ladybugs , " but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn't seem as bad as it is .  dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price .  	negative

( all sounding like good fun so far ? )  the 'penalty' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow . )  based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar .  this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made .  everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters .  williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that's all it is : a face .  there's no emotion behind it .  sciora's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film .  she may look pretty , but she can't act .  max von sydow is o . k as the traveller , if nothing special .  cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film .  it's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement .  all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground .  there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don't help to get anything out of the performers .  while films like e . t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically .  instead , it's all rather boring .  sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography isn't bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there's something lacking .  the script doesn't help , filled with hopeless romantic clich ? s , and dud speeches .  richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams .  despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing .  the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid .  but there's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects .  heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets .  but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 .  instead of raising questions about existence , it raises boredom .  sadly , i recommend you give this film a miss .  better luck next time , robin .  a david wilcock review ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes  	negative

neg_444	the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin .  both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations .  in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and " rambo " -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures .  spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead .  though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) .  he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon .  but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death .  typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video .  while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold .  but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) .  so many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel .  while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power .  spawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie .  	negative
neg_447	after the huge success of " the exorcist " in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely .  needless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with .  to start the " story " it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) .  now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan's body , before it is too late .  some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn't go anywhere .  louise fletcher is alright for what it's worth , but she could have done a lot better than this .  the direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn't figure out .  in fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad .  for those exorcist fans who haven't seen this one , i recommend renting it .  i actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else !  im not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere .  bad , bad , bad movie .  	negative
neg_458	by starring in amy heckerling's " clueless " two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of " the crush " -- out of the water .  her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's " batman & robin , " where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl .  now , she's the star and producer of " excess baggage , " a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level .  silverstone's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally .  in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw .  but before the police can " rescue " her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who's still trapped in the back .  when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there .  along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation .  it doesn't help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who's wise to his niece's ploys for attention and has mafia connections .  for at least a half-hour , " excess baggage " bounces along fast and efficiently .  during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor .  but once it's past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once .  a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and " excess baggage " likely covers its territory .  of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome .   " do you like my tummy ? "  emily coos to vincent at one point in the film .  huh ?  did i miss something ?  the hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes .  then again , " excess baggage " becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise .  a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn't game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded .  motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative .  scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions .   " excess baggage " has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand .  i loved silverstone's turn in " clueless " as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen's " emma . "  looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for " excess baggage . "  sadly , however , " excess baggage " is no " clueless . "  but , on the other hand , it is clueless .  	negative

neg_467	in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america .  i guess i was expecting some sort of political question .  instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind .   " in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "  he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked .  even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws .  perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage .  a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy .  meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however .  greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her .  he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding .  from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) .  through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage .  and he has to ask to borrow clothing .  it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down .  as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes .  greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to .  but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law .  this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship .  it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films .  but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived .  too many coincidences in the story work against greg .  the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky .  certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him .  there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy .  certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written .  the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance .  deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can .  the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities .  but we do not really see much of that digging .  ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen .  it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen .  but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that .  randy newman has written a playful score .  in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before .  there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s .  presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination .  humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment .  but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me .  i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  	negative

"  when fern discovers what has happened , the fab 3 make her an offer she can't refuse -- make-up !  they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan .  the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah .  the teachers fare no better , especially in the ridiculous lines they are given .   " miss shayne , please cover your bosom , " one young teacher , who has been made up to look old and ugly , says without any conviction .   " this is a learning institution , not a brothel . "  besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made , there is one other question that i'd like to ask the director .  why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ?  in a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz's murder .  as she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it .  i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it .  jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 .  it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex .  i would advise everyone to avoid it , but if teenagers go they should be older and mature .  	negative
neg_469	hollywood never fails to astound me .  every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool .  i was truly convinced that " wild wild west " marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes " end of days " to prove me wrong .  this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects .  the result ?  nothing but groans and yawns .  even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept .  at the very least , " end of days " should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that .  it's just lousy .  arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and " batman & robin , " plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something .  along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from " friends " ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo .  it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 ) .  if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , " the chosen one , " their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat .  ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house .  the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p . m . and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky ) .  and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary .  you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil .  a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl .  arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression .  and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own .  oh , the anguish !  oh , the humanity !  oh , the writing !  andrew w . marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character .  cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first " lethal weapon , " preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter .  twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling .  when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter .  in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter .  subtle , marlowe , subtle .  speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying .  hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions .  eager to satisfy arnold's core audience , he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well .  what a guy .  had the film delivered some decent scares , or even maintained a consistently ominous tone , the bombastic clich ? s might have been tolerable , but " end of days " is simply a flaccid special effects show .  the cast is just as ineffective .  in his early scenes , gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache , but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster .  kevin pollak comes and goes quickly , robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold , well ? he's a better actor than casper van dien .  that should count for something .  way back in the aftermath " the exorcist " and " the omen , " supernatural swill like " end of days " might have passed muster as a b-movie .  but that was then and this is now .   " the x-files " and " buffy the vampire slayer " deliver real scares on a weekly basis and , if we want to see the devil , all we have to do is flip on " the 700 club " and take a gander at pat robertson's grinning maw .  after enduring " end of days , " all i can say is " get thee behind me , satan .  and while you're at it , get thee a better agent as well .

neg_472	it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried .  the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be .  ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold .  blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks .  co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe .  the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion .  important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict .  obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues .  the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close .  there are forced messages here and there : " go forward ; always go forward , " lola preaches to suzie ; there's romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler's nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie's desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago .  the film's main problem is that potter isn't skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie .  the time period's instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any .  by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater .  the film's falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ?  contrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film .  although it's apparent that potter can't grasp what she reaches , i'm puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place .  ricci's suzie is meant to be the film's core : from the extended flashback at the film's beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her .  so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ?  the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci's .  the almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny's beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations wonderfully .  also worthy of note are lindy hemming's costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely .  and then there's the music .  from minute one to minute ninety-seven , there's hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola's interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film's characters and reinforce that state ) .  potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn't given towards ( almost ) everything else .  	negative
neg_474	how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ?  isn't there a law or something ?  this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst .  mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison .  writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill .  the plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father .  deciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder .  but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way .  the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe .  whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing .  the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : " i hate that mouse " .  oh cringe !  this is home alone all over again , and ten times worse .  one touching scene early on is worth mentioning .  we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall .  he jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone .  it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film .  a message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors .  this kind of rubbish will just not do at all .  	negative
neg_476	a backdrop of new year's eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie .  the decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth its weight in aquanet , and the louder the fashion , the better the look .  but despite this setting , these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with " 200 cigarettes . "  a better title for this nostalgic mess would be " 50 missed opportunities . "  what is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ?  it's certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies .  there's courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in " the opposite of sex " ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about " good will hunting . "  perhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ?  maybe it looked good on paper .   " 200 cigarettes " is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york's festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) .  among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines .  more subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light .  all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick's cube .  ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city .  infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo .  hudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop .  are we laughing yet ?  the film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former .  game performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle .  too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other .  if this is " 200 cigarettes , " then get me 200 nicotine patches .  	negative

neg_483	movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers .  occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called " teenagers . "  can't hardly wait , however , does not .  instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to .  can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation .  the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) .  i couldn't stand any of those characters .  whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming " yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! " ,  all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .  apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny .  in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour .  and when i say " forced " , i mean it .  they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .  this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .  for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as " i am a sex machine . "  for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny .  if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .  	negative

" too bad we have to do it , " mitch says .  here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used .  at least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic .  but at least it isn't dull , and it isn't predictable .  and that's the way it should be .  it's sketch comedy , and if you're a fan of norm macdonald , you'll love it .  the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care .  if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one .  the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care .  so before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley .  the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) .  i just couldn't stop laughing .  	negative
neg_496	an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels .  it's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting .  harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime .  his luck hasn't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition .  she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) .  at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) .  but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm .  palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together .  it's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers .  sure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial .  a lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations .  even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story .  some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) .  the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more .  woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist .  elisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn't add anything special to the role .  chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth .  some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances .  and to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow .  as the movie grinds to a halt , you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto .  if you're in the mood for this type of movie , you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .  	negative
neg_497	this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard .  the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . . ned  kelly , the so-called robin hood of the aussies .  but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly .  the film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution .  then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family .  this scene is set in 1871 .  in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein's lyrics , which tells -- of ned's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic .  ned says a debt must be paid . . .  as he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge .  so begins ned's romp through australia's outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered .  he begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners .  when he's only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds .  when ned's mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother's freedom .  when the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers .  rampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who don't trust the traps ( police ) .  spoiler to follow in the next paragraph .  in the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured .  ned's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive .  but kelly's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys .  this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice .  jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson .  the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian .  under richardson's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry .  if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch " mad dog morgan " ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner .  	negative
